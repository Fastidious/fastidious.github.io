      <p>It is not difficult to realize, even for the untrained eye, that english is not my mother language. Spanish is. I have been &ldquo;using&rdquo; english for eight years now, but I have improved very little. Believe me, when you are as old as I am and, on top of that, are not that good with languages, getting where I have gotten today is quite an accomplishment, although one that leaves plenty space for improvement.</p>
<p>So, you will see misspellings and grammatical errors on my entries. If corrections are <a href="mailto:david@collantes.us" title="Send them over!">sent to me</a> I will gratefully edit things accordingly. But understand that writing the way I do is what makes me unique (even though I belong the a great bunch just like me, including fellow Americans &mdash;born in America, that is, not naturalized).</p>
<p>I wish I could write like <a href="http://www.scribbling.net/" title="Gina">her</a>, or like <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/" title="Mark">him</a>, <a href="http://ftrain.com/" title="Paul">him</a>, <a href="http://jogin.com/" title="Tomas">him</a> or <a href="http://www.geeworld.com/" title="Gee">him</a>. Sigh&hellip; maybe one day.</p>
