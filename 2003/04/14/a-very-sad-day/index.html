      <p>I have, many times, felt saddened while thinking about the fragility of life. I feel often perturbed by the fact the life itself is very short. Throughout life we strive to achieve goals, whether they are set goals or not: we get an education, or try to, we search for happiness, we build an &ldquo;empire&rdquo; around us. And everything, everything disappears at the end. Does it makes any sense then? What is the reason of life?</p>
<p>I think that what we accomplish while alive is just the answer to that. But it is not a matter of success. It is a matter of how the accomplishment is made: being honest, rightous, generous, good&hellip; spending time with your parents and family, with your kids, doing good for others. Forgiving, not hating. So many things&hellip; Life is already too short, you see? We should not waste it on the negative.</p>
<p>Why do I bring this topic today? My dear uncle Eddie is dying. He had had two massive strokes and medical doctors spoke: he is not going to make it. Of course, only God has the last word, but the doctors diagnose is not hopeful. My uncle&rsquo;s life was an accomplished one. He has been an example to follow and when he is gone he will be missed and remembered. I will make sure to talk to my kid about him. Now if he just didn&rsquo;t have to go now&hellip;</p>
<p>I feel sad. Good people should never die.</p>
