<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a perceptible shift in attitude. <strong>Military action</strong> was now seen as <strong>inevitable</strong>. <strong>Bush wanted</strong> to remove Saddam, through military action, <strong>justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD</strong>. But the <strong>intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy</strong>. The NSC had <strong>no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm</strong> for publishing material on the Iraqi regime&rsquo;s record. <strong>There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action</strong>&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;No decisions had been taken, but he thought the <strong>most likely timing in US minds for military action</strong> to begin was January, with the timeline <strong>beginning 30 days before the US Congressional elections</strong>&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;The Foreign Secretary said he would discuss this with Colin Powell this week. <strong>It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action</strong>, even if the timing was not yet decided. <strong>But the case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbors, and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran</strong>. We should work up a plan for an ultimatum to Saddam to allow back in the UN weapons inspectors. This would also help with the legal justification for the use of force&hellip;</p>

<p>Oh boy, oh boy&hellip; don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
