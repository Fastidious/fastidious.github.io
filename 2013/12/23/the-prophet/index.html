      <p>At the end of each episode of &ldquo;<a href="http://the-big-bang-theory.com/">The Big Bang Theory</a>&rdquo; there is always something witty printed, that passes by so fast you can not read it. Today I saw, and remembered, &ldquo;<em>&hellip; the prophet did not answer right away &hellip;</em>.&rdquo; I looked it up, and this came up.</p>
<h3 id="the-prophet"><span class="hash"><a href="#the-prophet" class="post__hash"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></span>The Prophet</h3><blockquote>
<p>A young woman stepped forward from the throng and asked, <em>&ldquo;0' great prophet, tell us how we might find love that is unconditional, unwavering and unending.&quot;</em> The prophet did not answer right away. He looked off into the distance, gathering his thoughts. Silence descended upon the crowd. Then he turned his gaze upon the young woman and said, <em>&ldquo;Get a dog.&quot;</em></p>
