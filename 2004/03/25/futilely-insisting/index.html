      <p>Human nature is quite interesting and I type so based on my own experience. I am talking about myself.</p>
<p>It amazes me that I keep going to check for new entries or read comments, once &mdash; and sometimes two, three, four times &mdash; a day on <a href="http://www.ambivalent.us/" title="Eryk weblog">Ambivalent.US</a>, when I disagree 9 out of 10 with everything the owner has to say (actually, write). Same thing happens with <a href="http://www.hivelogic.com/" title="Dan Benjamin">Hivelogic</a>, I go there every day just to find a boring, uninteresting entry, still I go. Actually, with <a href="http://www.hivelogic.com/" title="Dan Benjamin">Hivelogic</a> what it bothers me the most is not to be able to comment and tell Dan how damn boring he is at times.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kalsey.com/" title="Adam Kalsey weblog">Adam Kalsey</a> is another one I visit daily, even though he barely updates. Same applies to <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/" title="Brad Choate weblog">Brad Choate</a>, <a href="http://www.explodingfist.com/" title="Reid Philpot weblog">Reid Philpot</a>, <a href="http://www.geeworld.com/" title="Gee World :-)">Gee</a> and <a href="http://www.raelity.org/" title="Rael">Rael</a>. <a href="http://tesugen.com/" title="Mr. Lindsberg">Peter Lindsberg</a> weblog is another that I daily go and I do not even know why, since the guy writes so philosophically deep about programming and what nots that 99% of the time I have no idea of what he is talking about.</p>
<p>I wonder what the brave two or three that come by every once and then think about this very own spot&hellip;</p>
