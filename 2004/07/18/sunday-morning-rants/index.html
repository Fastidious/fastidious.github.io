      <p>As I <a href="/2004/07/14/the-worse-web-browser/" title="The worse web browser">previously wrote</a>,  I believe IE is no match to Firefox. I will tell everyone I know about its problems, I will show those to them if I can. I will praise the goods of Firefox, so everyone I know will enjoy web browsing as much as I am. But&hellip;</p>
<p>One thing is not using IE and another thing is not serving pages to those using it. That&rsquo;s plain wrong. It is like going to a japanese restaurant and have sushi denied because you are not japanese. I will do my best to &ldquo;serve&rdquo; good viewable pages to everyone including, yes, those using IE. IE users will not get redirected to a <a href="http://www.betterbrowser.org/" title="Better browser">better browser</a> website or <a href="http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/browserupgrades.html" title="Browser upgrades: Get a standards-compliant browser">evangelist website</a>. I will let them know there is something better out there, but I will not punish anyone just because they do not know better or insist on using something else. That would not be right.</p>
<p>On my feeds I do not give out full posts nor comments entries, just as Zeldman and a lot of others. Someone <a href="http://www.mojombo.com/archives/000050.html" title="An open letter the the blogosphere.">thinks differently</a>.  As Jeffrey once wrote, refering to RSS &ldquo;&hellip;If you stored your groceries on the sidewalk, we could eat your food without sitting across the table from you&hellip;&rdquo; He also wrote &ldquo;&hellip;reading Plastic Bag &mdash;or zeldman.com, presumably&mdash; in a news reader is like getting the text of your favorite magazine in email. Nice. But not the same.&rdquo; Offering full posts on any feed would defeat the purpose of the web, the rich experience of it. For me, RSS feeds are teasers &mdash;just like movie teasers&mdash;. If you want to whole thing, come by. Unlike movie theathers, there is no charge.</p>
