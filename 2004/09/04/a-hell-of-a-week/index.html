      <p>It has been a hell of a week and continues to be so. KM has been the whole week (and still is!) sick. Sick to a point that kept me home all those days. Kim and I have been very worried and needless is to say that our days hasn&rsquo;t been fun one&rsquo;s, to say the least.</p>
<p>To top it off, now we have got Frances, the hurricane that is, about to slam on us. Are we unprepared? Yes. After the week we had had we do not need anything else, honestly. I just hope it will stay category 2 or less&hellip; or that it will change course. I might be asking for too much. If everything is fine, I shall be back sometime next week. Or maybe not.</p>
