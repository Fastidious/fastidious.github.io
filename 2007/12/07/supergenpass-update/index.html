<p>Chris Zarate has updated his SuperGenPass bookmarlet, which now has it&rsquo;s own dedicated domain. Version 1.1 comes with (from the website):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Moveable window: The SuperGenPass window can be moved by dragging the title bar.</li>
	<li>Smarter password capturing: When multiple master passwords are found, the conflict must be resolved by double-clicking the desired field.</li>
    <li>Smarter autopopulate: Autopopulate is on by default, but only for fields where the master password was found. Other fields can be manually populated by double-clicking.</li>
	<li>Protocol check: SuperGenPass will now work on FTP sites (when viewed in a Web browser). It will also fail gracefully on all protocols other than HTTP and FTP.</li>
	<li>Updated look: Small changes in user interface; more consistent across browsers; better resistance to style overrides.</li>
	<li>Usability: Enter key will submit forms; returns focus intelligently.</li>
</ul>
<p>I first mentioned about this on my <a href="/2005/05/29/single-sign-on/" title="Single Sign on"> Single Sign on</a> post, and I have been using ever since. Nice to see Chris keeps the utility fresh and useful.</p>
