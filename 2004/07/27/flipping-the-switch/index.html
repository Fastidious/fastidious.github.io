      <p>Next Monday (August 2nd) we are flipping the switch from the old reliable Linux based email system (Sendmail, Washington University IMAP/POP3) to a relatively newly deployed Microsoft Exchange 2003. Needless is to say that we &ndash;<a href="http://www.bus.ucf.edu/" title="College of Business Administration, the TRC web page is on the Intranet">TRC</a> staff&ndash; all have been busy wrapping things up to minimize the impact. But things &ndash;bad things, unexpected things&ndash; are bound to happen. It is just a matter of time.</p>
<p>With Exchange I say good bye to the taken-for-granted reliability, easy maintenance and trouble free email system that we had, to dive into the unknown. I am not only a bit stressed, I am feeling sentimental. The system we are moving away from has been with us for seven long years. Seven long years of excellent service. I have no complains and infinite praise.</p>
<p>If, by any chance, you happen to manage an Exchange 2000/2003 single server or farm, <a href="mailto:david@collantes.us?Subject=Exchange 2000/2003" title="Contact me">get in touch</a>. I would like to keep your contact information handy :-)</p>
