      <p>It seems our credit “worthiness” (and hence our capabilities to acquired
loans in the future) has diminished:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>S&amp;P maintained its ‘AAA/A-1+’ credit rating on U.S. sovereign debt,
saying the nation’s “highly diversified” economy and “effective monetary
policies” have helped support growth.</p>
<p>But the ratings agency lowered its outlook for America’s long-term
credit rating to “negative” from “stable,” based on the uncertain
political debate around the nation’s fiscal problems.</p>
