      <p>I despise Emoji and emoticons, specially graphical emoji, or people who continuously abuse them, and interject them in every single sentence they type, sometimes even more than once. I thought that I hated &ldquo;LOL,&rdquo; which I do, but I would rather see LOL &mdash; when justified, not the moronic &ldquo;LOL&rdquo; without reason you see often &mdash; than see the utter idiotic smiles, winks, etc., continuously, all the time. &ldquo;<em>I am an elitist asshole, but here, have an Emoji! That way you will perceive me differently.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I just wanted to state my rant here, where I do not bother anyone. Maybe in the future, when someone who overuses Emoji today reaches to me to tell me they have changed their mind, that they hate them now, I will be able to say, while browsing to this entry, “I told you so.&quot;</p>
