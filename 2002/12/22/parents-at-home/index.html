      <p>We have my parents visiting for Christmas and New Year. Kent Martin is already showing his happiness and he remembered my dad. I am glad it is not too cold &mdash; at least for now &mdash; so my parents time is more enjoyable (meaning they will be able to go out with us and such). I have miss them a lot and I am really happy to have them with us for a while. It is curious, but now that I am older &mdash; and a father myself &mdash; I really appreciate what my parents did for me. Money can&rsquo;t buy, not even Mastercard!</p>
<p>A few more days and I will be having some days off. I can&rsquo;t hardly wait&hellip;</p>
