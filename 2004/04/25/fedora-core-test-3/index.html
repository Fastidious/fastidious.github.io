      <p>I have installed Fedora Core Test 2 on my new <a href="/2004/04/04/life-with-an-xps/" title="Life with an XPS">XPS</a> (dual boot), ran up2date, gotten Test 3 and I must say it is one sweet, nice coming along distribution. Hardened with <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/" title="Security-Enhanced Linux">SELinux</a>, running kernel 2.6.3 and with a nice <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/projects/package-list/" title="Package List for Fedora Core 1">set of packages</a> available, Fedora will certainly stand out.</p>
<p>I am really contemplating getting one of those mighty <a href="http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/compare.aspx/servers?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd" title="Dell PowerEdge Servers">cheap Dell servers</a>, get Fedora (once it is released) installed and collocate. I might do that, seriously. We —actually, I will have to team up to pay collo fees— might do that.</p>
<p>I will repeat some links for your enjoyment and perusal (or simply to induce boredom on you):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/" title="Fedora Project">Fedora Project</a>, sponsored by Red Hat.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/" title="SELinux">Security Enhanced Linux</a>, by the NSA.</li>
<li><a href="http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/compare.aspx/servers?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd" title="Dell PowerEdge Servers">Dell servers</a>, the cheap kind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy! :-)</p>
