      <p>Well, my hiatus and upcoming photoblog are taking longer than anticipated. That&rsquo;s due, most of the time, to lack of time. We have moved our offices to a new building (I am talking about work here) and things have been hectic at times. That added to Kent Martin&rsquo;s growing up and the task of educating him becoming more important &ndash;and difficult&ndash; has taken all the little free time I have on my hands.</p>
<p>It is true that I had had some really &ldquo;free&rdquo; time. But then the inspiration hasn&rsquo;t come to alow me to finish the photoblog interface. Then, of course, I need much more time to go around Orlando taking pictures. Orlando is not a city that gives too much inspiration to a photo amateur: there are not old buildings around and it is always sunny (well, when it is not raining).</p>
<p>The photoblog will come. I already got my cameras ready: a Nikon N50, a Nikon 5700, a Ricoh S35 and two beautiful Rollei&rsquo;s, one 3.5 and another 2.8 with Planar lens <em>and</em> in perfect shape (even though they are over 50 years old). I got a scanner as well, thanks to the sugestion of the guy who runs <a href="http://www.ambivalent.us/" title="Ambivalent">Ambivalent</a>, Eryk. It is an Epson 3200 Pro, which allows scanning of film negatives up to 120mm.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s the recount, so far. I will come back, hopefully soon. When that happens, the new photoblog will be online instead of this site (or I even decide to run both simultaneously). A weekend is ahead, have a nice one!</p>
