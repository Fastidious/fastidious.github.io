<p>Tryggr, my main character, has reached level 57 now. A Rogue (dwarf) level 20 and a Paladin (dwarf) level 29 keeps him in company. All still in Argent Dawn. Kent characters, a Priest (night elf) level 10 (Alviss) and an Mage (undead) level 5 (Luciferous) reside on the same server.</p>
<p>What can I say, WoW is awesome! :-)</p>
