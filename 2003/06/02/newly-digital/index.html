      <p>I started using computers back in 1985. The PC&rsquo;s I used were old dinosaurs, running at the blazing speeds of 2 MHz, with 640KB of RAM, no hard drive and 5&rdquo; 1/4 floppy drives. I could turn the machine on and go to flirt with girls on the halls of my college while it was booting. Sometimes I even had time to make out!</p>
<p>Programing was done with Quick Basic or Turbo Basic, and floppies had to be swaped at times, in endless search of the &ldquo;command.com&rdquo;. I had a whole collection of floppies, all carefully protected on a cardboard box I made and that I carried with me almost all the time. They were, after all, my most valuable posession.</p>
<p>I never had a PC of my own, not until 1992. I always used my school&rsquo;s machines, so I was famous for always being on the labs or sleeping on the local Computer Club. I would always reserve machine time at nights, since most of the people would use them during the daylight and nights were mostly open. I have to point out that the labs on my school and the Computer Club were open 24/7/365.</p>
<p>I first connected to the Internet in January 1992. I send my first email using a Radio Packet BBS that had Internet connection. I beta tested Mosaic and needless is to say I saw the raise and downfall of Netscape. I paid $7.00 an hour for an Internet connection with <a href="http://www.holonet.net/" title="Holonet">Holonet</a>, after I got tired of my local Freenet. Life was good.</p>
<p>Had had several computers ever since, including Macs and IBM Risc based. My life has revolved around computers and still does. Perhaps there isn&rsquo;t a heaven, but your data packets get routed to a faster pipeline&hellip;</p>
