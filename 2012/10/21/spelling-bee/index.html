      <p>As a foreigner, trying to go over a Spelling Bee word list with my kid is nothing less than a challenge. For the both of us. First, there are the words I have never seeing; those I can&rsquo;t pronounce. Second, there are the words I will mispronounce. And third, there are the ones I don&rsquo;t know what they mean.</p>
<p>If you add to that the fact that the kid is learning them, hence bound to make many mistakes&hellip; well, yes, a challenge, to put it mildly. It gives me a headache. I will be glad when is over. 26 October can&rsquo;t come fast enough.</p>
