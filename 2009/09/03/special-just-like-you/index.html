<p>I am 26 years old, just started work with Central bank of Nigeria, as a scientist and  why i was diong  system maintance . I came across your file which was marked X and your released disk painted RED, I took time to study it and found out that you have paid VIRTUALLY all fees and certificate but the fund has not been release to you. The most annoying thing is that they cannot tell you the truth that on no account will they ever release the fund to you, instead they let you spend money unnecessarily. I do not intend to work here all the days of my life, I can release this fund to you if you can certify me of my security, and how I can run away from this Nigeria if I do this, because if I don&rsquo;t run away from this country after i make the transfer, I will seriously be in trouble and my life will be in danger.</p>
<p>You may not understand it because you are not a Nigerian. The only thing I will need to release this fund is a special HARD DISK we call it HD120 GIG. I will buy two of it, recopy your information, destroy the previous one, punch the computer to reflect in your bank.  I will clean up the tracer and destroy your file, after which I will run away from Nigeria to meet with you. If you are interested.</p>
<p>Do get in touch with me immediately.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Miss Linda Jones<br>

<p>The part that I found really funny was:</p>

<p>The name Linda Jones sounds very Nigerian, don&rsquo;t you think? <strong>Smile</strong>. And the &ldquo;HARD DISK name? <strong>Wide smile</strong>. And the <em>punching</em> of the computer? <strong>Laughing hard</strong>.</p>
<p>Please, keep them coming, Linda Jones, <a href="http://antifraudintl.org/showthread.php?t=19917">Onyeka Blessing</a>, <a href="http://lofi-gaming.org.uk/blog/2009/06/05/best-nigerian-scam-email-in-ages/">Jane James</a>, or whatever other name you might have.</p>
