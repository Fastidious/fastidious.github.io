      <p>While visiting <a href="http://www.south.com/" title="South">South</a> today I found, once again, this quote that I like so much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this, &lsquo;What is the use of climbing Mount Everest?&rsquo; and my answer must at once be, &lsquo;It is no use.&rsquo; We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver, not a gem, nor any coal or iron. We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food. It&rsquo;s no use. So, if you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward, then you won&rsquo;t see why we go. What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy. And joy is, after all, the end of life. We do not live to eat and make money. <strong>We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life</strong>. That is what life means and what life is for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t the same quotation be applied to life itself?</p>
