<p>All my domains have resided on a <a href="http://www.serverbeach.com/">ServerBeach</a> dedicated server for over <a href="/2004/05/25/changing-servers/">six years now</a>. I have tried to find <a href="/2007/04/07/godaddy-and-mediatemple/">something else</a> before (cheaper, price wise), but I always stayed on ServerBeach, as they have always been reliable, with fast connections.</p>
<p>The server that until recently hosted my domains has long been at the end of life, and the reason it was never replaced  was because the alternative, on a comparable hardware, was more expensive. Yes, my EOL server was &ldquo;grandfathered.&rdquo; So I went <a href="/2009/11/24/host-hunting/">off to research</a> and find my domains a new home, and after a couple of months I decided to pick a virtual machine from <a href="http://linode.com/">Linode</a>, a virtual server (Xen) provider. I had had my Linode for about a week now, and I could not be happier.</p>
<p>Unlike many other virtual server providers, Linode allows you to boot a very small Linux distribution (they have a <a href="http://www.linode.com/faq.cfm">list</a> of the supported ones on their website) that you can then use to build upon, adding only the bits and pieces that interests you. Their management utility &mdash;<a href="http://www.linode.com/features.cfm">Linode Manager</a>&mdash; is quite simple, yet powerful and organized. It allows for all management (including recovery) of your Linode. You can also pick the geographical <a href="http://www.linode.com/why.cfm">location</a> of your Linode.</p>
