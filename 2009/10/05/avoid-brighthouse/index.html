      <p>I live in Central Florida. In my area, if I want cable TV and Internet, I have no choice but to use Bright House services. The competition is satellite TV/Internet and/or DSL (for Internet). Why am I recommending to avoid Bright House, if you can? It is simple: their service is far from being of a good quality and/or reliable. I will elaborate a little.</p>
<p>On cable TV, you get black screens (no video or audio), or &ldquo;<strong>Please wait</strong>&rdquo; screens, constantly and randomly. You call, they send a technician, which normally finds nothing wrong. Yet the problems re-occur. Most of the times, those problems happen often (a second or two of screen black outs, sound out), but at times they last 30 minutes to an hour. Don&rsquo;t bother trying to call them, their lines are never available when those problems arise. They will ring busy or with problems all the time. No update on cable outages anywhere. They do have Internet &ldquo;status&rdquo; information, that gets updated a day after the fact.</p>
<p>Internet connectivity will often crawl or come to a stop. That seems to happen, of course, at the time you need it the most. You can call them, and 99.9% of the time they will only schedule a technician visit, which might or might not fix present and near future problems. Just toss a coin. And there is never a credit for problems, although I would settle for an acknowledgement at least. Finding out through local news the next day that there were problems speaks very little about the company.</p>
<p>If you are in Central Florida, or directly affected by Bright House service (or lack thereof), let me know. I would be curious to know about your &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; with them.</p>
