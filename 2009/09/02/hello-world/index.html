<p>There isn&rsquo;t one single reason why I am starting over, but a few. Basically, the old weblog database was &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; with entries and rows, and tables from plugins&hellip; and god knows what other things (I ran quite a few experiments on that one). It was also designed in a way that made it very hard to just port (odd photos sizes, nasty CSS, etc).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it!</p>
