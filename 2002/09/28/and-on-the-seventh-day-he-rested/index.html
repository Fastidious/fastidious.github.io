We went to the mall today, just to walk the kids around. The kids, you may ask? Well, we took Kent Martin and cousin Alyssa (six months younger) with us today. It was pretty tiresome to handle both of them, but it helped us to realize that we have enought with Kent Martin&hellip; for now." />

      <p>Saturday is about over, at least for me. There is not much to tell about it, it just passed away silently, without much ado.</p>
<p>We went to the mall today, just to walk the kids around. The kids, you may ask? Well, we took Kent Martin and cousin Alyssa (six months younger) with us today. It was pretty tiresome to handle both of them, but it helped us to realize that we have enought with Kent Martin&hellip; for now.</p>
<p>On the new websites design topic, I already have on my mind what I want on eosgraphy.com: it will be a simple design, just the way I want it. Coming soon, stay posted.</p>
<p>I was watching &ldquo;The Green Mile&rdquo;, but I had to come by. I am afraid that I will be too sleepy to write anything afterwards. Now, let&rsquo;s rest.</p>
