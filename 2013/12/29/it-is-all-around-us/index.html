      <p>Love. It really is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion&rsquo;s starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don&rsquo;t see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it&rsquo;s not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it&rsquo;s always there &mdash; fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge &mdash; they were all messages of love. If you look for it, I&rsquo;ve got a sneaky feeling you&rsquo;ll find that love actually is all around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last night I was looking for a movie to watch in both, <a href="https://signup.netflix.com">Netflix</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Video/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2858778011">Amazon Video</a>. I wasn&rsquo;t having much luck, until I came across to this, now veteran, one. I have watched it a few times, but it doesn&rsquo;t get old, specially around this time. So, even though Christmas is now a recent memory, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Actually">Love Actually</a> isn&rsquo;t.</p>
