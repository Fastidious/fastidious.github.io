      <p>Recently I got the PS3 game &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassins_Creed:_Brotherhood">Assassin Creed Brotherhood</a>&rdquo; for my birthday and it has being very fun. My dad got me the <a href="http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> code, and playing him is very fun as well. I have already gotten the <a href="http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Armor_of_Brutus">armor of Brutus</a>, the very best on the game.
