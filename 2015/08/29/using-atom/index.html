      <p>I have used many editors in the past, either under Windows or OS X. Too many, I have really lost the count. The last one I used was <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. Great editor, cross platform too, but pricey. Each time I would get the nag, I would feel guilty for not buying me a licensed copy.</p>
<p>I tried <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> when it first came out. It was buggy and slow, really, really slow. Not anymore. I am using version <code>1.0.9</code> now, and it is a joy. So fast, so customizable, so complete, so free!</p>
