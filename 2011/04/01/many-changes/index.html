 After much thought, and tinkering, I decided to ditch my six year old or so WordPress and start blogging like a hacker with the awesome Jekyll.

 Moved to Linode. Love it, highly recommend it. They reward customers that bring referrals, but notice my links do not have any referral code." />

      <p>Just very recently <a href="/2011/02/03/forget-hyde-get-jekyll/">I wrote</a> about me moving to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Ruby
static site generator">Jekyll</a> from WordPress:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After much thought, and tinkering, I decided to ditch my six year old
or so WordPress and start <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">blogging like a hacker</a>
with the awesome <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also wrote —fairly recently— about <a href="/2011/01/14/living-on-a-linode/">living on a Linode</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moved to Linode. Love it, highly recommend it. They reward customers
that bring referrals, but notice my links do not have any referral
code. That much I like their product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, not even two months after, I need to publicly admit:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> isn’t
good. I hate it! I am going back to WordPress.</li>
<li><a href="http://linode.com/">Linode</a> is horrible. I have
decided instead to host with Godaddy.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s that.</p>
