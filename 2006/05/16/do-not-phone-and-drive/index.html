      <p>It infuriates me the idiots who think (and insist) that driving a car while talking on their mobile phones represents no problem for them or those around. Well, it does, fools! I have done it, I confess &ndash;although I have stopped doing so for a while, unless it is a  real emergency&ndash; and I know what I am talking about. A driver handling a phone conversation while driving is impaired. It is!</p>
<p>So, for the stupids out there still using their mobile phones to keep their idiotic conversations (idiotic, because on a 99.9% percent of the time it is senseless conversation or a conversation that can wait for a more appropriated time), stop. I was one of you, I was able to quit. You could too.</p>
