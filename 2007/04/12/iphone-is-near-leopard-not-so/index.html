      <p>For many Apple fans (me included) that were anxiously waiting for both products, this is a good and slight bad news. Good news, iPhone is on track and it will be delivered as promised. Slight bad news, we will have to wait a bit longer for the Big Cat to come out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/">Apple - Hot News</a> &ndash; iPhone has already passed several of its required certification tests and is on schedule to ship in late June as planned. We can&rsquo;t wait until customers get their hands (and fingers) on it and experience what a revolutionary and magical product it is. However, iPhone contains the most sophisticated software ever shipped on a mobile device, and finishing it on time has not come without a price as we had to borrow some key software engineering and QA resources from our Mac OS X team, and as a result we will not be able to release Leopard at our Worldwide Developers Conference in early June as planned. While Leopard&rsquo;s features will be complete by then, we cannot deliver the quality release that we and our customers expect from us. We now plan to show our developers a near final version of Leopard at the conference, give them a beta copy to take home so they can do their final testing, and ship Leopard in October. We think it will be well worth the wait. Life often presents tradeoffs, and in this case we&rsquo;re sure we&rsquo;ve made the right ones.&rdquo; &ndash; Apr 12, 2007 &ndash; <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple Inc.</a></p>

<p>Of course, this all brings some advantage to me. I was planning on buying a new Apple Mac upon Leopard release. The delay just gives me more time to save.</p>
