      <p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to really step outside yourself and view yourself as a stranger would?</p>
<p>&hellip;What do you think that would be like? And how accurate do you think it is?</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know how I would view myself. Probably as someone who is shy, afraid, and introverted. I guess I come off as those on a first impression, but it could not be farther from the truth. I am so different to those I know and trust than I am to those that I meet for the first time. I wonder if I can, one day, pinpoint the exact second that a person goes from being a stranger to being a friend, in my mind. I wonder what triggers that transformation.</p>
<p>I wish I could objectively see myself, so I could fix my flaws. I know, I know - we shouldn&rsquo;t think these things, we should be happy with who we are. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - I am very proud of what I am, of my accomplishments. I, however, do not know if I am proud of who I am. Is there really a difference?</p>
<p>Or am I just rambling at 3 in the morning?</p>
