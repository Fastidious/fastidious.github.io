      <p>We <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-led_intervention_in_Iraq_(2014%E2%80%93present)">bomb</a>. From the <a href="http://csis.org/files/publication/100610_AfPakAir.War.Stats.pdf">air</a>, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%9314)">ground</a>, from afar, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk_(missile)#Operational_history">ships</a>. And so do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War">the Russians</a> now. We target what we believe are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror">terrorists</a>, sometimes we miss. Russians are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/01/middleeast/russia-syria/">doing the same</a> now.</p>
<p>We removed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq">Saddam</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban#U.S.-led_NATO_invasion_of_Afghanistan.2C_Taliban_overthrow_and_insurgency">Taliban</a>, just to mention two, and that created&mdash;or increased&mdash;a mess that continues until today. The Russian&rsquo;s tactic is different, they are targeting both, the terrorists fighting against the &ldquo;<em>official</em>&rdquo; regime, and those which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intervention_against_ISIL">we are targeting</a> as well. The way I see it, <em>both</em> seem to be terrorists. Removing Bashar al-Assad&mdash;the current Syrian president&mdash;right now would just make matters worse. We should know that.</p>
<p>Just this time, I think we should, perhaps, be united with the Russians. That, or completely out of the way. And, above all, we should avoid hypocrisy and sensationalism.</p>
