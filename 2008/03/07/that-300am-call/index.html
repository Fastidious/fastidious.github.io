 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 3AM and your children are sleeping. But the phone is ringing. It&rsquo;s your mortgage lender, calling to let you know that you are 180 days late on your payment for that crazy mortgage you agreed to. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, because your phone was disconnected a long time ago. But no worries, Hillary Clinton is working late, at some desk somewhere, doing a Sudoku puzzle maybe." />

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 3AM and your children are sleeping. But the phone is ringing. It&rsquo;s your mortgage lender, calling to let you know that you are 180 days late on your payment for that crazy mortgage you agreed to. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, because your phone was disconnected a long time ago. But no worries, Hillary Clinton is working late, at some desk somewhere, doing a Sudoku puzzle maybe. And she supports a 90 day moratorium on foreclosures. What is it that&rsquo;s going to happen in those ninety days to solve your problem? Hell, she doesn&rsquo;t even have the slighest clue and she really doesn&rsquo;t care. But words like &ldquo;90-day&rdquo; and &ldquo;moratorium&rdquo; sure test well. &lsquo;I am Hillary Clinton and I approve this message. You have 90 days to pack up your crap and get out of that house.'&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly a more believable 3:00AM call&hellip; and answer.</p>
