      <p>Our vehicle was towed away earlier this week because I parked it on the street momentarily during the day, and completely forgot to move it back to the driveway at dusk. Our neighbourhood strictly enforces a no street parking from 00:00 to 06:00, so we paid the consequences of an old mind&rsquo;s oversight.</p>
<p>Other than having to pick it up, spending time, and money&ndash;it cost $125 to get it back&ndash;we worried about the poor automobile. It was alone, scared, and lonely, in an unknown territory. We wondered if it had thoughts like &ldquo;Where are they taking me?&rdquo; â€“ &ldquo;What is this dirty place?&rdquo; â€“ &ldquo;What am I doing here?&rdquo; â€“ &ldquo;What have I done to deserve this?&rdquo; â€“ &ldquo;I am so scared!&rdquo; and so on. ðŸ˜¢</p>
