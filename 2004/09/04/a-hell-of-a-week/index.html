<p>To top it off, now we have got Frances, the hurricane that is, about to slam on us. Are we unprepared? Yes. After the week we had had we do not need anything else, honestly. I just hope it will stay category 2 or less&hellip; or that it will change course. I might be asking for too much. If everything is fine, I shall be back sometime next week. Or maybe not.</p>
