 If this truly happened, it is disappointing. A person as charismatic as Pope Francis, who has been so politically careful, should have known better. She is a government employee, fulfilling an official task. She must abide the law, or simply leave her job, if she can&rsquo;t perform as expected. What would we do if our troops, due to their religious beliefs, decide to put down their weapons?" />

<p>If this truly happened, it is disappointing. A person as charismatic as Pope Francis, who has been so politically careful, should have known better. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-same-sex-marriage-kentucky-20150902-story.html">She</a> is a government employee, fulfilling an official task. She must abide the law, or simply leave her job, if she can&rsquo;t perform as expected. What would we do if our troops, due to their religious beliefs, decide to put down their weapons? Should they still be in our military?</p>
<p>Should I have been in the Pope&rsquo;s clothes, I would have steered away from such dilemma. It would have been, at the very least, the smart thing to do.</p>
