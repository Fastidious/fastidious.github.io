      <p>Just like a Phoenix, this is a rebirth from my own ashes. I wanted to change things around here, perhaps change the way I write. Finally, I have decided to come back on a more informal way. Like it was in the beginning, when I decided that blogging could be a fun thing to do.</p>
<p>How informal will it be? Well, as informal as life itself &mdash; at least, mine &mdash;. I will write things that happen to me, my family, my friends and fellow human beings in general. I will not hold back just because I may think my writing might not interest certain audience, I will just write &mdash; or will try to. When I decided to &ldquo;rest for a while&rdquo;, I receive two emails from two friends and co-workers. &ldquo;I browse to it every once in a while to read it&hellip;&rdquo;, one said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? It&rsquo;s really down? Do you still want the server hosting?&rdquo; said the other. Enough said.</p>
<p>I am back.</p>
