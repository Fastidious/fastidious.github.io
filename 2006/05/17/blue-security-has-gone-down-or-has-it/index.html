<p>To which I replied, via email, to their press relations contact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>You thought you lost? You haven&rsquo;t, yet! Open source the server, web module and client. Release it to the community. You will see how 1,000&rsquo;s if not millions of Blue Security&rsquo;s alike will raise and spammers will &lsquo;really&rsquo; know how hell feels like.</p>
<p>Open the source, let us have it. Your company will always live in us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think that would be a good idea? I think it would.</p>
