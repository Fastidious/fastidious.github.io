<p><a href="http://apcmag.com/5835/vendors_in_no_rush_to_ditch_xp_for_vista">Windows XP to be phased out by year&rsquo;s end despite customer demand</a> &ndash; Computer makers have been told they&rsquo;ll no longer be able to get Windows XP OEM by the end of this year, despite consumer resistance to Vista and its compatibility problems.</p>
<p>By early 2008, Microsoft&rsquo;s contracts with computer makers will require companies to only sell Vista-loaded machines. &ldquo;The OEM version of XP Professional goes next January,&rdquo; said Frank Luburic, senior ThinkPad product manager for Lenovo. &ldquo;At that point, they&rsquo;ll have no choice.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://apcmag.com/">APC Magazine</a></p>

<p>I was expecting to see something like this somewhere around Vista&rsquo;s SP1 or so. I guess I was wrong, unless Vista SP1 is around the corner and we don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
