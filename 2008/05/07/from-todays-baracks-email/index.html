<meta property="og:description" content="News broke this morning that Senator Clinton made three separate loans to her campaign in the past 30 days &mdash;including one as recently as Monday.
These loans total more than $6.4 million, which combined with her previous personal loans, add up to at least $11.4 million she&rsquo;s loaned her campaign since February.
A spokesman said she may continue to &ldquo;loan the campaign additional money out of her jointly-held assets&rdquo; &mdash;which include more than $100 million in income since her husband left the White House." />
