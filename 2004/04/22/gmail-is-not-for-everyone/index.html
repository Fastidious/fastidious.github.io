      <p>I have used Gmail now a little bit. Sometimes I am a lucky guy; I have experienced good luck several times: when I met Kim, when my child was born, when I first flew over the Atlantic. This time my luck came in the form of a Gmail account. Thanks to those who graciously offered me the chance to see with my own eyes what many other mortals have ambition.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that much that is not <a href="http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/2004/04/17/using_gmail" title="Using Gmail">already said</a>, but this: Gmail is not for everyone. It is not for the untrained HotMail/AOL/Other lame services luser. Gmail will confuse the hell out of them  and they will be lost, like non-pilots on an airplane cockpit. Furthermore, they will not like it: it does not have smilies! ;-)</p>
<p>For the power users Gmail is still missing auto-signature, email text font change (I like fixed fonts on my emails), a keyboard shortcut for deleting messages &mdash; I know, why to delete when you&rsquo;ve got 1 GB! Well, I do not want to save crap &mdash;, the capability to add your own customized headers, more criteria on the rules creation, and more rules (<a href="http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/2004/04/17/using_gmail#1971" title="Comment on Jogin: Using Gmail">limit is 20</a>, right Tomas?).</p>
<p>I am still playing around with Gmail, but I have seeing enough to re-afirm what I previously said &ldquo;<a href="/2004/04/17/gmail-hype/" title="Gmail Hype">&hellip;Google is going to offer a webmail service and is going to do it well&hellip;</a>&rdquo;. Next gOS (Google Operating System), g.NET and tomorrow &ldquo;&hellip;plan to take over the world!&rdquo; :-)</p>
