      <p>Yesterday (15 October) Kent told me he doesn&rsquo;t want to take AP (Advanced Placement) classes next year. He also told me he might not want to be a neurological surgeon after all, and that he really doesn&rsquo;t know what he will want to be, professionally. We talked more, but the rest of it has no place in here.</p>
<p>Amongst the many feelings I am experiencing, regret is one of them. If only my parents were alive. I can&rsquo;t express with words how very sorry I am for the many bad times I made them go through.</p>
