      <p>Not much is happening lately. At least, not much worth of mentioning. Christmas is coming (yes, Christmas, I do not need to be &ldquo;politically&rdquo; correct by calling it &ldquo;holidays&rdquo;) and I tend to get a little bit sad just around this time. I know it might sound weird, but I can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>Time is flying by lately and I do not know whether that&rsquo;s good or bad. It should be bad all the time, since time is one of the few things that never returns, it can&rsquo;t be rewinded. But while at work, it is good to see time passing by quick, not because I do not want to work, but because I look forward, everyday, to get home and be with my kid&hellip; and my wife. The time I spend with them is quite minimal, if the amount of time I spend at work and driving is taken into consideration. So, the quicker the time passes, the sooner I will be with them. Kent is growing and changing very fast. I wish I could witness every step of that growth.</p>
<p>What else? Hmm, I do not longer have a digital camera, so I will be using <a href="http://www.sxc.hu/" title="Stock.Xchng">Stock.Xchng</a> free stock photos, until a digital camera falls into my hands again. I might use some scanning from my film SLR every once and then, but not that often. Film photography is great but it is costly.</p>
<p>And, finally, I have been thinking on a small change of style around here, once again. Perhaps a main column and a left or right smaller one. Fixed, centered. But I do not know. I do not have that much content to cover side columns, unless once I have them, the content will come. &ldquo;If you build it, they will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Cheers, mates! Have nice weekend!</p>
