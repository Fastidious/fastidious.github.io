      <p>It is interesting to find out, at times when some minority wants to have removed &ldquo;&hellip;under God&hellip;&rdquo; from the Pledge of Allegiance, about this &mdash;it refers to the Great Seal of the United States of America motto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The federal courts have held that the motto symbolizes the historical role of religion in our society, Lynch, 465 U.S. at 676, formalizes our medium of exchange, see O&rsquo;Hair v. Blumenthal, 462 F. Supp. 19, 20 (W.D. Tex.), aff&rsquo;d sub nom. O&rsquo;Hair v. Murray, 588 F.2d 1144 (5th Cir. 1978) (per curiam), and cert. denied, 442 U.S.930 (1979), fosters patriotism, see Aronow v. United States, 432 F.2d 242, 243 (9th Cir. 1970), and expresses confidence in the future, Lynch, 465 U.S. at 692-93 (O&rsquo;Connor, J., concurring). The motto&rsquo;s primary effect is not to advance religion; instead, it is a form of &ldquo;ceremonial deism&rdquo; which through historical usage and ubiquity cannot be reasonably understood to convey government approval of religious belief. Allegheny, 492 U.S. at 625 (O&rsquo;Connor, J., concurring); Lynch, 465 U.S. at 693 (O&rsquo;Connor, J., concurring); id. at 716 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Finally, the motto does not create an intimate relationship of the type that suggests unconstitutional entanglement of church and state. O&rsquo;Hair, 462 F. Supp. at 20. After making [inquiries], we find that a reasonable observer, aware of the purpose, context, and history of the phrase &ldquo;In God we trust,&rdquo; would not consider its use or its reproduction on U.S. currency to be an endorsement of religion. (Gaylor vs USA, 10th Cir. 1996)</p>

<p>I sincerely do not understand what the whole fuss is about. That been said, I agree with the minority (I know, I am contradicting myself).</p>
