      <p>This has been a short weekend and I am tired. I wish I could talk about the great things I did, but it was mainly staying home, going to mom-in-law house and being with baby (and wife), of course.</p>
<p>I can tell I am growing old at a fast pace. You see, we are all moving towards elderly, that&rsquo;s nothing new, but it does normally happens slow, or doesn&rsquo;t it? Well, if that is the case &ndash;that is, it happens slow&ndash;, I do not know what failed on me. It seems like the years were piling up on top of me and then, suddenly, they just fell. If I start writting down every single spot that hurts on my body I would tire the most patient reader. Honestly. When the pain started I thought it was something that would go away in a few days but, oh boy, was I in for a surprise! No, I am not seventy. I am thirty four.</p>
<p>Well, as I said, it was a short week and I should have guessed it will be, since the preceding week was also short. I want to think that the next week will bring some peace to my rumble skeleton.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the news, I think I am the only person who does not have the details on the latest on the Iraq conflict. I spared a few minutes &ndash;sixty to be exact&ndash; to come up with a different interface here last night and now this, typed while Kent falls asleep. I am going to browse the news right now, and perhaps to read a few emails that I am sure I have. Let&rsquo;s hope I did not kill anyone of boredom.</p>
