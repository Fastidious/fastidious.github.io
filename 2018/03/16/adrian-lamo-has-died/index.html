      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Lamo">Adrian Lamo</a>, mostly known as the hacker who broke into several major companies computer networks, and indirectly reported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning">Chelsea Manning</a>, has died — cause unknown thus far. The news was posted on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16601470">Hacker News</a>, of course, and I found <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16602166">one the comments</a> — true or not — left there interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a car, while my friend did not, and Adrian had traveled via transit, so I spent the day with them hopping around town. At one point, we were downtown grabbing food in one of the larger complexes — Adrian breaks off for a second and asks a retail store employee a bunch of questions about working there, saying he was just hired at the cafe. We then ended up going into what was clearly an employee-only area — GUYS WE AREN&rsquo;T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE WHAT IF WE GET IN TROUBLE OH GOD — we duck into a fire escape, hike up to the upper level where he picks the lock to the door with roof access, and there we are, highest point in the city. After a few minutes of me suggesting that MAYBE we go back down since this was cool BUT REALLY WE SHOULD GO, Adrian told me I&rsquo;d miss the sunset if I kept worrying.</p>

<p>I did not know at all about him, although his name kind of rings a bell, probably for seeing it while perusing news.</p>
