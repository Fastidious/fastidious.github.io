      <p>A while ago, I wrote about the <a href="/2007/05/01/c3-is-no-more/" title="C3 is no more">closing of the C3 School</a>, previously known as Parkway Preparatory School. As many other parents and staff, I was sad to see the school my kid attended to disappearing. And there were rumors, so I asked a senior Pastor (do not remember his name now) about them. I was told the Church wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere, that the rumors about selling the Church were unfounded. I told him I was going to be very disappointed if the rumors were right, and we weren&rsquo;t told the truth. It seems <a href="http://byronbledsoeblog.com/2007/10/07/were-not-play-it-safe-were-c3/">I have reasons</a> to be disappointed after all.</p>
<p>You see, we saw the Church change names, run a big mail and street sign advertising, add signs to the Church area, change the front sign to a brand new, fancy C3 one. They spend good money conveying C3, &ldquo;Connecting the Community with Christ&rdquo; message. To then sell and move to a local theater? It seems there was no management and plans were being made and changed daily.</p>
<p>We were lied to, we were let down. Very disappointing. They had the right to do whatever they pleased with the Church, but I think we deserved to be openly told why the school was really closing. We had even pre-paid for the upcoming year registration, for Pete&rsquo;s sake!</p>
<p>C3 didn&rsquo;t connect my family with Christ. It just took us a step further away from him.</p>
