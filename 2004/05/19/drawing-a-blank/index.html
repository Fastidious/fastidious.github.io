      <p>I am drawing a blank trying to decided the new layout of this site. I have no problems with the previous one, but as I am running a <a href="/2004/05/13/in-the-process-of-moving/" title="Related post.">new engine</a> here I would like the layout to be new as well. I spent a significant amount of time yesterday trying to come up with something and all went to waste.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am procastinating until I see Wordpress 1.2 out, and have all links to be cruft free. Right now the paging, whether on categories or archives (Posts Paged on WP options) does not spit out clean URI&rsquo;s, which bothers me a lot. I know, I have a problem. I can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>After the difficult decision is made and the new layout is up, I will resume my normal activities. Actually, I will post daily, like I used to do back in 2002.</p>
