Since I wasn&rsquo;t choosen to beta test, I can not offer any <a href="http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/2004/04/15/juice" title="Jogin.COM: Juice">excellent insider view</a>, but I can write about what I think of the whole thing. The reason of this post is to keep a record, for the posterity, about my point of view on this whole thing.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s get to the point. I think Gmail will be awesome, if it <a href="http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/GmailLetter.htm" title="Organizations have asked Google to suspend the service.">opens at all</a> for the general public (&ldquo;We think it&rsquo;s an absolute invasion of privacy. It&rsquo;s like having a massive billboard in the middle of your home,' said Sen. Liz Figueroa, a Democrat from Fremont, California. &lsquo;We are asking them to rethink the whole product,&rsquo; she said.&quot;). I think that anyone that might have privacy concerns &ndash;or any other&ndash; should refrain from using it; after all nobody at Google is forcing you to get an account (accounts aren&rsquo;t available at the time I am typing this).</p>
<p>If I were Hotmail or any other webmail provider, I would be afraid. Google is going to offer a webmail service and is going to do it well, like everything it has done so far. As I said on <a href="http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/2004/04/15/juice#comment-1953" title="My comment on Tomas 'Juice' entry.">my comment</a> over Tomas Jogin related entry, &ldquo;<span class="mark">I can&rsquo;t speak for the rest of the guys/gals, but I love Google. Should they go public I will buy Google stock. Google makes my every day life so much easier that praising them is the least I can do.</span>&rdquo;</p>
