<p>The founder of craigslist, the free social-networking and classifieds Web site, said on Thursday he is not interested in selling out, just hours after MySpace.com was valued at $15 billion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who needs the money? We don&rsquo;t really care,&rdquo; Craig Newmark said in an interview at the Picnic &lsquo;06 Cross Media Week conference in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re living comfortably, what&rsquo;s the point of having more?&rdquo; Newmark said.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Newmark said raising the money to subsequently give it away to good causes also did not interest him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding a good cause is incredibly hard and time-consuming,&rdquo; he said, adding that he and Chief Executive Jim Buckmaster agree on not cashing in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both know some people who own more than a billion (dollars) and they&rsquo;re not any the happier. They also need bodyguards,&rdquo; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow I really like the way this guy thinks. He is living comfortably. He doesn&rsquo;t want or need to have more. I wish more people (if not everyone) would think like him.</p>
