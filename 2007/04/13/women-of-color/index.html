      <p>That term, women of color, emphasized by me below has always puzzled me. Aren&rsquo;t all women and, as a matter of fact, all of us &ldquo;of color&rdquo;? What kind of silly (avoiding the use of a stronger word) terminology is that? And, why aren&rsquo;t those &ldquo;people of goodwill&rdquo; asking for the same treatment to be given to rappers, comedians, writers, etc? Utterly stupid.</p>

<p><strong>CBS chairman, Leslie Moonves</strong> &ndash; &ldquo;Those who have spoken with us the last few days represent people of goodwill from all segments of our society  &ndash;all races, economic groups, men and women alike. In our meetings with concerned groups, there has been much discussion of the effect language like this has on our young people, particularly young <span class="mark">women of color</span> trying to make their way in this society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This has gone too far. Every time I see a black &ldquo;reverend&rdquo; involved into things like this, it makes me sick. They seem to have forgotten they &ldquo;can&rsquo;t serve two masters.&rdquo;</p>
