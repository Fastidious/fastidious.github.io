      <p>We have gone through quite a few cameras. The very first one we recall was a <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canond30">Canon EOS D30</a>, with an <em>amazing</em> 3.2 megapixel &mdash; sarcasm aside, it took amazing photos. After that we had had many Sony Cyber-shots, a Canon <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canona640/">Powershot A640</a>, a couple of Canon <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/list/cameras/point-and-shoot">Powershot Gs</a>, and another bigger Canon, the <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/dslr/eos-6d">EOS 6D</a>. In between we have used the camera that comes with the iPhones, starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)">iPhone 2G</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the iPhone camera isn&rsquo;t too bad, and since we already carry the phone, it also means we carry a camera everywhere we go. Yet, neither wife nor I fully enjoy the photos that come out of it. In a bind, the iPhone camera does a decent job, but when looking for higher resolution, to blow up photos, or when greater details are needed, it simply doesn&rsquo;t cut it. For that we need a dedicated camera. It is that need which have brought us, inexorably, here.</p>
<p>Which camera to buy? We really do not want to spend over $500, but we understand there aren&rsquo;t many good choices at that price range. The <a href="http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_a5/">Fujifilm X-A5</a> goes for around $600, and it is not really that great. The Canon <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-m-series-digital-cameras/eos-m50-ef-m-15-45mm-is-stm-kit">EOS M50</a>, on the other hand, looks like a very good camera (and we like Canon very much), but it goes for $900. So, decisions, decisions. Which one to get?</p>
<p>We really could use some advise, so if you are reading this, and have one to offer, <a href="mailto:david@collantes.us">please do</a>.</p>
