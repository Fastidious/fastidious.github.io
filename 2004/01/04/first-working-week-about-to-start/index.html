      <p>The 2004 first working week (at least for me) is about to start. I know it is going to be difficult after 4 and a half days off, but hey, &ldquo;a man has to do what a man has to do&hellip;&rdquo;. I hope we (TRC staff) will know early this week who was the choosen one for <a href="/2003/12/26/good-bye-2003/" title="See references to this on this post.">the position</a> we interviewed people for.</p>
<p>Went to sleep early today (around 2:00 AM). I was playing with <a href="http://www.slysoft.com/en/anydvd.html" title="Slysoft AnyDVD.">AnyDVD</a> and <a href="http://www.elby.ch/en/products/clone_dvd/" title="Elby's CloneDVD.">CloneDVD</a>, making a few backup copies of KM&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/spongebob/" title="Nickelodeon Spongebob Squarepants web site.">Spongebob Squarepants</a> DVDs. It is amazing the quality one can get, when bonuses, featurettes, captions and foreign languages are left behind.</p>
<p>As always, woke up early today and soon after KM was awake. I was in the process of creating the header for this post when it happened and now he and Kim are waiting for me to finish this, rushing me to type faster. KM wants me to go and buy <a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/samuraijack/" title="Cartoon Network: Samurai Jack.">Samurai Jack</a> clothes for him, sword included. I will probably update in the afternoon, or evening before the day is over.</p>
<p><strong>10:34 PM:</strong> We ended up going to Lake Eola, downtown Orlando. KM cousin, Alyssa, went with us and while the kids had a blast, the adults got beat up :-) Actually, it is very satisfying seeing the kids having a blast. We are just getting old.</p>
<p>We got home and KM went to sleep for three and a half consecutive hours, so as we all imagine, he is still awake, watching &ldquo;Die another Day &ndash; 007&rdquo;. Before that, he kept me hijacked on the bedroom, playing bad and good guys (fighting). Weird, tonight he decided he wanted to be a bad guy, but he wanted to win as well. Hmm, I wonder what kind of TV is he watching during the day&hellip;</p>
<p>I have decided (20 plus emails made me decide, better said) to bring back the comments. They will come, for the first time, on a pop-up window. I will try to work on it next week.</p>
<p>Well, it has been a long day and I am going to wrap it up. Dashing out to hit the sack!</p>
