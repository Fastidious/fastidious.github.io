      <p>The weekend has started. It really started yesterday&rsquo;s afternoon, but who is keeping tabs? The fact is, it is here and thus it brings a dilemma. If I do nothing&mdash;which is impossible if you have a kid&mdash;the weekend will fly by. On the other hand, if I get busy&mdash;and I will&mdash;it will fly by as well.</p>
<p>There are little things in life that keeps you, in a short term, looking forward to a near future. Of course there are others that makes you want to stop time, so that near future will not come. For now, I look forward to getting the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/" title="iPad">iPad</a>, next week. In a way, I want time to fly. But I also want the weekend to never end. Can&rsquo;t have it all, right?</p>
<p>Breakfast at 10:00AM sounds right.</p>
