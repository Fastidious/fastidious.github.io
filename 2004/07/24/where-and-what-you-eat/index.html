      <p>While browsing the &ldquo;Orlando Sentinel Express&rdquo; I found the section <strong>Restaurant Penalties</strong>, which I never saw before &ndash;well, it is true that I do not browse the Sentinel Express everyday.</p>
<p>From that section, two restaurant violations caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Giovanni&rsquo;s Restaurant &amp; Pizza</strong>, 2140 S. Chickasaw Trail &ndash; &ldquo;&hellip;several five gallons pans of pizza and tomato sauce also were found without covers in the walk-in cooler. Raw whole shell eggs were found stored above produce in the walk-in cooler. A black mold like substance was observed on the ceiling inside the ice machine. The hand sink in the dish room was blocked with several soiled towels and a chemical storage rack&hellip; The in-use sandwich and salad cutting boards were badly scoured and stained&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Giovanni&rsquo;s is a neighborhood restaurant, just half a mile from my house. Pretty popular establishment, I assure you. We have ordered food once or twice from there.</p>
<p>The other is a McDonald&rsquo;s on a fairly good area, Winter Park:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>McDonald&rsquo;s</strong>,  4260 State Road 426 &ndash; &ldquo;&hellip;found potentially hazardous food stored at an unsafe temperature&hellip; also observed a worker wearing only one glove preparing ready-to-eat hamburgers with both hands&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those are just two very small examples. There is a lot that escapes the eyes when you go lunching or dinning out. Where to go and what to eat? Choose wisely!</p>
