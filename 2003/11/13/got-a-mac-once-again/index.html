      <p>My first knowledge about Mac&rsquo;s came sorrounded by a mist of legend, legend that has lived until today: Mac&rsquo;s are wonderful, powerful, friendly machines, that boot with a graphic interface and which mouse has only one big button. Ok, that was what I thought 15 years ago or so, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Eight months ago I bought a dual 1.42 Ghz PowerMac G4, with 2GB RAM, 128 VRAM, 120GB HD, SuperDrive, Bluetooth&hellip; beautiful machine. Then wife lost her job and some of my most valuable posessions got sold: my <a href="http://www.canoneos.com/d60/" title="Canon Digital SLR">D60</a> and all the associated lens&hellip; and my dream machine. But I longed, I longed for one. And one has come.</p>
<p>Granted, it is not a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/" title="PowerMac G5">G5</a>. It is not even a dual processor and not close to its predecesor, but it does the job quite well and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" title="Mac OS X">Panther</a> roams her kingdom. The vitals? A single processor at 933 Mhz, 1.5GB (well, soon to be 1.5GB, right now it is only 512MB) RAM, Superdive, 60GB hardrive, 64MB VRAM and, of course, ethernet, USB&rsquo;s, firewire&hellip; and bluetooth ready.</p>
<p>Now if only I could publish to my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/" title="Apple iCal">iCal</a> calendars from different places (machines), and eliminate threading on <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/" title="Mac OS X Mail">Mail App</a> based on subjects I would be a happier man. Nonetheless, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" title="Mac OS X">Panther</a> is great and I look forward to a long, loving relationship with Apocalypse (that her name). Needless is to say that I have not touched my Wintel at home since she got into the house.</p>
<p>No hard feelings, Foobar (Wintel name), but I switched!</p>
