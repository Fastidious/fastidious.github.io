      <p>I have been using <a href="/2011/02/03/forget-hyde-get-jekyll/">Jekyll</a> for a while now, but all this time I have been generating it on the server, That is, I had had a directory on the server holding the Jekyll files, in which I would run <code>jekyll build</code> to generate the website. Not too streamlined.</p>
<p>Before hosting this weblog on <a href="http://www.vultr.com/?ref=6815414">Vultr</a>, I had it on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, and their <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Pages</a> would do the publishing for me, right after a commit, which was great. Yesterday I decided to implement the same, but on my VPS. This is what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Created empty git repository (<code>git init --bare website.git</code>).</li>
<li>Cloned it.</li>
<li>Added my Jekyll files.</li>
</ol>
<p>What was left was to add the following <code>post-receive</code> hook<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#8a8a8a;background-color:#1c1c1c;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#5f8700">#!/bin/bash -l
</span><span style="color:#5f8700"></span><span style="color:#0087ff">GIT_REPOSITORY</span>=/path/to/my/website.git
<span style="color:#0087ff">TMP_GIT_CLONE</span>=/tmp/git/website
<span style="color:#0087ff">WWW_ROOT</span>=/path/to/my/website

git clone <span style="color:#0087ff">$GIT_REPOSITORY</span> <span style="color:#0087ff">$TMP_GIT_CLONE</span>
jekyll build --source <span style="color:#0087ff">$TMP_GIT_CLONE</span> --destination <span style="color:#0087ff">$WWW_ROOT</span>
rm -rf <span style="color:#0087ff">$TMP_GIT_CLONE</span>
<span style="color:#0087ff">exit</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now a few seconds right after committing, my website will show the changes. Being able to use Atom with <code>markdown-writer</code> to compose entries, and use git to deploy them is a bliss.</p>
