<meta property="og:description" content="Kent&rsquo;s latest hobby is to play Shogi. That makes me an obligatory player and fan as well since, just like chess, Shogi requires two players. We bought a cheap board from Amazon, but he has already stated that a better quality board and pieces is what he would want for Christmas (yes, he is already planning for it).
The game isn&rsquo;t difficult to play, but I am having an excruciating hard time remembering each piece&mdash;labeled with kanji characters&mdash;and how they move." />

      <p>Kent&rsquo;s latest hobby is to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi">Shogi</a>. That makes me an obligatory player and fan as well since, just like chess, Shogi requires two players. We bought a cheap board from Amazon, but he has already stated that a better quality board and pieces is what he would want for Christmas (yes, he is already planning for it).</p>
<p>The game isn&rsquo;t difficult to play, but I am having an excruciating hard time remembering each piece&mdash;labeled with kanji characters&mdash;and how they move. Ah, the joys of growing older!</p>
