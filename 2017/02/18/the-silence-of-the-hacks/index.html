      <p>There is a reason why I subscribed to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?src=3004&amp;campaignId=4XUYF&amp;module=Subscribe-Now&amp;pgtype=Homepage">digital edition</a> of <em>The New York Times</em>. Its journalists are superb; it is a paper I trust, and have found to be veridical after cross referencing the news they post with other major, equally trusted, news sources.</p>
<p>From yesterday&rsquo;s edition (some emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story so far: A foreign dictator <em>intervened</em> on behalf of a U.S. presidential candidate — and that candidate <strong>won</strong>. <em>Close associates</em> of the new president were <em>in contact</em> with the dictator’s espionage officials during the campaign, and his national security adviser was forced out over improper calls to that country’s ambassador — but not until the press reported it; the president <em>learned about his actions weeks earlier</em>, but took <strong>no action</strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the president seems <em>oddly solicitous</em> of the dictator’s interests, and rumors swirl about his personal financial connections to the country in question. Is there anything to those rumors? Nobody knows, in part <strong>because the president refuses to release his tax returns</strong>.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s nothing wrong here, and it’s all <em>perfectly innocent</em>. But if it’s not innocent, it’s <em>very bad indeed</em>. So what do Republicans in Congress, who have the power to investigate the situation, believe should be done?</p>
<p><strong>Nothing</strong>.</p>
