      <p>Ever since Amazon announced it&rsquo;s <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="Amazon Route 53">Route 53</a> service I have been dreaming on using it, but since I dislike to have services too spread out (got <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/">Google Apps</a> and <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> now), I held up. Two days ago or so, Amazon announced <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2011/02/17/Amazon-S3-Website-Features/" title="Static websites in your bucket">new features</a> that make hosting static websites&mdash;such as this one&mdash;on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a> buckets possible. This was it, just what I have been waiting for!</p>
<p>Promptly I set off to migrate one of my domains over Route 53. New buckets were created on my <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a>, to accommodate the new websites. Started to create all needed entries: Google Apps, all old &ldquo;<code>IN A</code>&rdquo; were converted to &ldquo;<code>IN CNAME</code>&rdquo;. Ready, set! Then it hit me.</p>
<p>Since the rules of DNS <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt">forbid CNAMEs</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> at the zone apex, you cannot set <em>domain.tld</em> (a &ldquo;naked&rdquo; domain) to also be a <code>CNAME</code> for your Amazon web enabled bucket. You need an &ldquo;<code>IN A</code>&rdquo;, an IP for that, which Amazon doesn&rsquo;t provide on S3. Bummer!</p>
<p>Too bad, so sad. Reversed everything. As we were!</p>

<p>If a CNAME RR is present at a node, no other data should be present; this ensures that the data for a canonical name and its aliases cannot be different. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
