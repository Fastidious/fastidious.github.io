<p>I have been very surprised to see, more and more, Microsoft ads on Freshmeat. All over the place. Quite often. Freshmeat lists thousands of applications, &ldquo;[&hellip;] preferably released under an open source license [&hellip;]&rdquo; . Microsoft != Open source. In fact, Microsoft considers open source a virus (well, at least Ballmer does). Why an, mainly, open source software repository will sell out like that?</p>
<p>I liked Freshmeat, and Slashdot. They were fresh (no pun intended), innovative. I liked them a lot when both weren&rsquo;t part of the OSTG, which is part of VA Software Corporation. Their decandence started then, somehow.</p>
