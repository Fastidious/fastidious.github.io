<p>She created me, all my flaws and gifts unintended. She nurtured and guided me through life the best she could, suffering for my mistakes&mdash;but always hopeful&mdash;and rejoicing on my victories. Always supportive she gave herself to me (and my siblings), selflessly.</p>
<p>After a lifetime mission, her time around here has expired. We knew it would come, but never fully prepared for it. And so we wept, sadness seeping through us. Forget her? Never. Miss her? Forever.</p>
