      <p>Today I came across <a href="http://www.vagabonding.com/" title="Vagabonding.com chronicles the solo, one year, round-the-world journey of Mike Pugh, an optimist from Chicago, USA.">Vagabonding</a> and I have to admit I felt jealous, in a good way. You see, traveling around the world has always been my unfulfilled dream and, even thought I have <acronym title="Several US states, Spain (duh), UK, France, Germany and Italy (briefly), Andorra, the Caribean...">traveled some</acronym>, I still hope one day (sooner rather than later) that dream will come true.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vagabonding.com/about/000013.html" title="About Mike.">Mike Pugh</a> lives and writes, with <a href="http://www.vagabonding.com/travelogue/000095.html" title="Petra, rock-cut jewel of the desert.">words</a> and <a href="http://www.vagabonding.com/gallery_app/view_album.php?set_albumName=nepal" title="Nepal.">pictures</a>, his <a href="http://www.vagabonding.com/archives.html" title="Travels archives.">travels</a> around the world and he does it well. What could be more energizing than fulfilling your hearts desire? <a href="http://www.vagabonding.com/" title="Vagabonding.com chronicles the solo, one year, round-the-world journey of Mike Pugh, an optimist from Chicago, USA.">Vagabonding</a> is a must see and read. Go and look, do not take my words for it.</p>
<p>Some people travel in a different way. Take John, from <a href="http://wantingseed.com/" title="Wanting Seed">Wanting Seed</a>, for example. He decided to study, learn and live the Chinese culture by going to <a href="http://wantingseed.com/weblog/2003/08/25/prepared_for_departure.php" title="Prepared for Departure.">school in China</a>. Pretty cool, huh? Oh boy, if only I were 20 years old and single! Not that I am complaining about my current status (husband and father), but youth and independence are very important to do what John did.</p>
<p>Finally, I thought I should mention <a href="http://ash.unfound.org/about.crap" title="About Joey">Joey</a>, the guy behind <a href="http://ash.unfound.org/" title="Ash">Ash</a>. Being from Brunei Darussalam, on the Borneo Island, he decided &mdash; for his own good, I presume &mdash; to travel to the <acronym title="Also known as Australia.">&ldquo;Land down Under&rdquo;</acronym>, also to study. But even though knowing new cultures and lands could be very exciting, Joey puts it simple when he writes: <em>&ldquo;I am not like most Bruneians, who want to leave Brunei and never come back.  I want to go back. Pronto.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Yes, traveling is great.  But I guess there is not sweeter place, after running around globe, than home sweet home.</p>
