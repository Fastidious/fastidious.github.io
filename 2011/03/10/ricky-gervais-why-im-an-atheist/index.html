<h3 id="ricky-gervais-why-im-an-atheist"><span class="hash"><a href="#ricky-gervais-why-im-an-atheist" class="post__hash"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></span>Ricky Gervais: Why I&rsquo;m an Atheist</h3><p>Why don&rsquo;t you believe in God? I get that question all the time. I always
try to give a sensitive, reasoned answer. This is usually awkward, time
consuming and pointless. People who believe in God don&rsquo;t need proof of
his existence, and they certainly don&rsquo;t want evidence to the contrary.
They are happy with their belief. They even say things like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s true
to me&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s faith.&rdquo; I still give my logical answer because I feel
that not being honest would be patronizing and impolite. It is ironic
therefore that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in God because there is absolutely no
scientific evidence for his existence and from what I&rsquo;ve heard the very
definition is a logical impossibility in this known universe,&rdquo; comes
across as both patronizing and impolite.</p>
<p>Arrogance is another accusation. Which seems particularly unfair.
Science seeks the truth. And it does not discriminate. For better or
worse it finds things out. Science is humble. It knows what it knows and
it knows what it doesn&rsquo;t know. It bases its conclusions and beliefs on
hard evidence &mdash; evidence that is constantly updated and upgraded. It
doesn&rsquo;t get offended when new facts come along. It embraces the body of
knowledge. It doesn&rsquo;t hold on to medieval practices because they are
tradition. If it did, you wouldn&rsquo;t get a shot of penicillin, you&rsquo;d pop a
leach down your trousers and pray. Whatever you &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; this is not
as effective as medicine. Again you can say, &ldquo;It works for me,&rdquo; but so
do placebos. My point being, I&rsquo;m saying God doesn&rsquo;t exist. I&rsquo;m not
saying faith doesn&rsquo;t exist. I know faith exists. I see it all the time.
But believing in something doesn&rsquo;t make it true. Hoping that something
is true doesn&rsquo;t make it true. The existence of God is not subjective. He
either exists or he doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not a matter of opinion. You can have
your own opinions. But you can&rsquo;t have your own facts.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t I believe in God? No, no no, why do YOU believe in God? Surely
the burden of proof is on the believer. You started all this. If I came
up to you and said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you believe I can fly?&rdquo; You&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Why
would I?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d reply, &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s a matter of faith.&rdquo; If I then said,
&ldquo;Prove I can&rsquo;t fly. Prove I can&rsquo;t fly see, see, you can&rsquo;t prove it can
you?&rdquo; You&rsquo;d probably either walk away, call security or throw me out of
the window and shout, &ldquo;F&mdash;ing fly then you lunatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, is of course a spirituality issue, religion is a different matter.
As an atheist, I see nothing &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; in believing in a god. I don&rsquo;t
think there is a god, but belief in him does no harm. If it helps you in
any way, then that&rsquo;s fine with me. It&rsquo;s when belief starts infringing on
other people&rsquo;s rights when it worries me. I would never deny your right
to believe in a god. I would just rather you didn&rsquo;t kill people who
believe in a different god, say. Or stone someone to death because your
rulebook says their sexuality is immoral. It&rsquo;s strange that anyone who
believes that an all-powerful all-knowing, omniscient power responsible
for everything that happens, would also want to judge and punish people
for what they are. From what I can gather, pretty much the worst type of
person you can be is an atheist. The first four commandments hammer this
point home. There is a god, I&rsquo;m him, no one else is, you&rsquo;re not as good
and don&rsquo;t forget it. (Don&rsquo;t murder anyone, doesn&rsquo;t get a mention till
number 6.)</p>
<p>When confronted with anyone who holds my lack of religious faith in such
contempt, I say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way God made me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what are atheists really being accused of?</p>
<p>The dictionary definition of God is &ldquo;a supernatural creator and overseer
of the universe.&rdquo; Included in this definition are all deities, goddesses
and supernatural beings. Since the beginning of recorded history, which
is defined by the invention of writing by the Sumerians around 6,000
years ago, historians have cataloged over 3700 supernatural beings, of
which 2870 can be considered deities.</p>
<p>So next time someone tells me they believe in God, I&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;Oh which
one? Zeus? Hades? Jupiter? Mars? Odin? Thor? Krishna? Vishnu? Ra?.&rdquo; If
they say &ldquo;Just God. I only believe in the one God,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll point out that
they are nearly as atheistic as me. I don&rsquo;t believe in 2,870 gods, and
they don&rsquo;t believe in 2,869.</p>
<p>I used to believe in God. The Christian one that is.</p>
<p>I loved Jesus. He was my hero. More than pop stars. More than
footballers. More than God. God was by definition omnipotent and
perfect. Jesus was a man. He had to work at it. He had temptation but
defeated sin. He had integrity and courage. But He was my hero because
He was kind. And He was kind to everyone. He didn&rsquo;t bow to peer pressure
or tyranny or cruelty. He didn&rsquo;t care who you were. He loved you. What a
guy. I wanted to be just like Him.</p>
<p>One day when I was about 8 years old, I was drawing the crucifixion as
part of my Bible studies homework. I loved art too. And nature. I loved
how God made all the animals. They were also perfect. Unconditionally
beautiful. It was an amazing world.</p>
<p>I lived in a very poor, working-class estate in an urban sprawl called
Reading, about 40 miles west of London. My father was a laborer and my
mother was a housewife. I was never ashamed of poverty. It was almost
noble. Also, everyone I knew was in the same situation, and I had
everything I needed. School was free. My clothes were cheap and always
clean and ironed. And mum was always cooking. She was cooking the day I
was drawing on the cross.</p>
<p>I was sitting at the kitchen table when my brother came home. He was 11
years older than me, so he would have been 19. He was as smart as anyone
I knew, but he was too cheeky. He would answer back and get into
trouble. I was a good boy. I went to church and believed in God &mdash; what a
relief for a working-class mother. You see, growing up where I did, mums
didn&rsquo;t hope as high as their kids growing up to be doctors; they just
hoped their kids didn&rsquo;t go to jail. So bring them up believing in God
and they&rsquo;ll be good and law abiding. It&rsquo;s a perfect system. Well,
nearly. 75 percent of Americans are God-fearing Christians; 75 percent
of prisoners are God-fearing Christians. 10 percent of Americans are
atheists; 0.2 percent of prisoners are atheists.</p>
<p>But anyway, there I was happily drawing my hero when my big brother Bob
asked, &ldquo;Why do you believe in God?&rdquo; Just a simple question. But my mum
panicked. &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; she said in a tone that I knew meant, &ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; Why
was that a bad thing to ask? If there was a God and my faith was strong
it didn&rsquo;t matter what people said.</p>
<p>Oh&hellip; hang on. There is no God. He knows it, and she knows it deep down. It
was as simple as that. I started thinking about it and asking more
questions, and within an hour, I was an atheist.</p>
<p>Wow. No God. If mum had lied to me about God, had she also lied to me
about Santa? Yes, of course, but who cares? The gifts kept coming. And
so did the gifts of my new found atheism. The gifts of truth, science,
nature. The real beauty of this world. I learned of evolution &mdash; a theory
so simple that only England&rsquo;s greatest genius could have come up with
it. Evolution of plants, animals and us &mdash; with imagination, free will,
love, humor. I no longer needed a reason for my existence, just a reason
to live. And imagination, free will, love, humor, fun, music, sports,
beer and pizza are all good enough reasons for living.</p>
<p>But living an honest life &mdash; for that you need the truth. That&rsquo;s the
other thing I learned that day, that the truth, however shocking or
uncomfortable, in the end leads to liberation and dignity.</p>
<p>So what does the question &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you believe in God?&rdquo; really mean. I
think when someone asks that they are really questioning their own
belief. In a way they are asking &ldquo;what makes you so special?&rdquo; &ldquo;How come
you weren&rsquo;t brainwashed with the rest of us?&rdquo; &ldquo;How dare you say I&rsquo;m a
fool and I&rsquo;m not going to heaven, f&mdash; you!&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s be honest, if one
person believed in God he would be considered pretty strange. But
because it&rsquo;s a very popular view it&rsquo;s accepted. And why is it such a
popular view? That&rsquo;s obvious. It&rsquo;s an attractive proposition. Believe in
me and live forever. Again if it was just a case of spirituality this
would be fine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It all comes down to respect. Forcing everyone to love everyone is impossible. But in love, or hate, you can always respect.</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do unto others&hellip; &quot; is a good rule of thumb. I live by that. Forgiveness
is probably the greatest virtue there is. But that&rsquo;s exactly what it is
&mdash; a virtue. Not just a Christian virtue. No one owns being good. I&rsquo;m
good. I just don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll be rewarded for it in heaven. My reward
is here and now. It&rsquo;s knowing that I try to do the right thing. That I
lived a good life. And that&rsquo;s where spirituality really lost its way.
When it became a stick to beat people with. &ldquo;Do this or you&rsquo;ll burn in
hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>You won&rsquo;t burn in hell</em>. <strong>But be nice anyway</strong>.</p>
