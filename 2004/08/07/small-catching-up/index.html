      <p>Last week was a busy week. The <a href="/2004/07/27/flipping-the-switch/" title="Flipping the switch">Exchange server</a> went into 3/4 full production and, yes, it crashed. For the first time I had to recover the PRIV and PUB databases and the server wasn&rsquo;t been on production not even a week! Oh boy&hellip;</p>
<p>I got the <a href="http://www.lingo.com/" title="Lingo">Lingo</a> gateway (VoIP gateway, that is) and the quality is excellent, while reaching their technical support is close to impossible. When I finally got a techie I told him I was starting to think <a href="http://www.lingo.com/" title="Lingo">Lingo</a> technical support was a myth. But he got me fixed (could not check my voicemails) in one minute, so&hellip; they are difficult to reach, but they are knowledgable. If you want to hear the quality of the sound, give me a call at 786-319-4778 (my alternate number in Miami) and we will chat.</p>
<p>Now ready for the weekend. I&rsquo;ll be back later, KM is waking up any time now&hellip;</p>

<p>Oh, and yesterday was my birthday. Not that I pay too much attention to birthdays, but when I am almost reaching fourty I guess it is worth mentioning :-)</p>
