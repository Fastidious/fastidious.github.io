 Oil companies getting tax breaks, and not passing those savings down, but pocketing them. The economic development in China and India, which increases the demand." />

<p>A very interesting post over Wired explains <a href="http://shurl.us/u/">some of the reasons</a>. A brief summary of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Oil companies getting tax breaks,  and not passing those savings down, but <a href="http://shurl.us/v/">pocketing them</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://shurl.us/z/">economic development</a> in China and India, which increases the demand.</li>
<li>Oil is priced in dollars and with the Federal Government preparing for yet <a href="http://shurl.us/k/">another interest cut</a>, the dollar value is simply decreasing. You need to pay more, for everything.</li>
<li>Traders (stock exchange, etc) are acting on fear, or greed, or both, keeping and raising the oil&rsquo;s <a href="http://shurl.us/i/">stock current value</a>.</li>
<li>Suppliers have <a href="http://shurl.us/e/">decreased their output</a>. Non-OPEC countries would normally boost their output when OPEN prices have gone too high. This time they have decrease it instead, due to political instability among others.</li>
</ol>

<p>The use of a local URL shortener &mdash;now defunct&mdash; has made all links on this post worthless. Do not be that stupid again, and use <a href="http://goo.gl/">Google&rsquo;s</a>. Or better yet, do not use any shortener at all.</p>
