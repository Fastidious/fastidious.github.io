      <p>Apple mobile devices&mdash;iPhones, iPads, iPods&mdash;are used everywhere. The <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Reports-May-2015-US-Smartphone-Subscriber-Market-Share">US smartphone subscriber market</a> share highest percentage is dominated by them. As an American company, they are bound to comply with U.S. laws and regulations. So, when the U.S. Justice Department <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/us/politics/apple-and-other-tech-companies-tangle-with-us-over-access-to-data.html?_r=0">requested</a> that Apple grants access to a locked iPhone, Apple brought the case to court.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple Inc told a U.S. judge that accessing data stored on a locked iPhone would be &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; with devices using its latest operating system, but the company has the &ldquo;technical ability&rdquo; to help law enforcement unlock older phones.</p>
<p>&mdash; <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/21/us-apple-court-encryption-idUSKCN0SE2NF20151021">Reuters</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technically, new iPhones running iOS 8 or higher are impossible to crack open; older iPhones are no problem. The iPhone in the U.S. Justice Department request is an old one, and hence not a problem for Apple to unlock. Nevertheless, Apple is asking the judge not to budge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Forcing Apple to extract data in this case, absent clear legal authority to do so, could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand,&rdquo; Apple&rsquo;s lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>&mdash; <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/21/us-apple-court-encryption-idUSKCN0SE2NF20151021">Reuters</a></p>

<p>Kudos to Apple!</p>
