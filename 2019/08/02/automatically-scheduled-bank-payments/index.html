      <p>So, you sign up for a gym, or another service, that gives you a small discount for paying using an automatic scheduled withdraw from your bank&rsquo;s checking account. Things go well for a while, then they go sour—or you simply change your mind—and you want to sever that agreement, to disconnect the link between them and <em>your</em> bank account. Guess what? <strong>You can&rsquo;t.</strong> Not through your mobile banking app, nor through a bank&rsquo;s web site,  call, or in-person visit. It is a long process, not a simple action.</p>
<p>Cancelling a scheduled payment is close to impossible. It is 2019, we are preparing to send people to Mars, but this can&rsquo;t be done simply. They can put a stop payment order to one, and/or future payments, but cutting ties?  They can&rsquo;t. In other words, if you set-up scheduled payments with your bank account, you are giving someone unlimited checks, hopefully with a pre-determined set amount.</p>
<p>To revoke authorisation you will need to go through a <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-stop-automatic-payments-from-my-bank-account-en-2023/">series of steps</a> which conclude with a never-ending monitoring of your account, just in case an unauthorised transfer occurs. Want to fully &ldquo;break up?&rdquo; Cancel your bank account, and create a new one. Moral of the story? Don&rsquo;t ever set-up automatic scheduled payments that withdraw funds from your bank account. Never. Ever.</p>
<p>As a side note, if you are a Bank of America (BofA) customer, and <strong>are not</strong> an <em>Advantage Member</em>, be prepared to pay $30 for a stop payment order. Luckily for me, I am.</p>
