      <blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;paradox of the active user&rdquo; is a concept introduced by <a href="http://ist.psu.edu/ist/directory/faculty/?EmployeeID=234">John M. Carroll</a> and <a href="http://faculty.ist.psu.edu/rosson/">Mary Beth Rosson</a> (then at <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>, now at <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">Penn State</a>) to explain a common observation in several user studies done at the IBM User Interface Institute in the early 1980s (later confirmed by many other studies, including my own): <b>Users never read manuals</b> but start using the software immediately. They are motivated to get started and to get their immediate task done: they don&rsquo;t care about the system as such and don&rsquo;t want to spend time up front on getting established, set up, or going through learning packages.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;paradox of the active user&rdquo; is a paradox because users would save time in the long term by taking some initial time to optimize the system and learn more about it. But that&rsquo;s not how people behave in the real world, so we cannot allow engineers to build products for an idealized rational user when real humans are irrational: we must design for the way users actually behave.</p>

<p>I think we will all agree that certain <a href="http://apple.com/">Cupertino</a> based company knows this quite well. And they act accordingly.</p>
