      <p>Olympics Games relate to sport. The Olympic Games is where the World most accomplished athletes and teams compete for medals, for the win. Making the Olympics Games a political chess board goes against what Olympic Games are all about. And it is a nasty thing to do.</p>
<p>We&mdash;as in the U.S.A.&mdash;are not being fair with China. Our government and our politicians (including Presidential aspirants) are all playing politics with the Olympics for their own political advantage. And they are all wrong, including Barack Obama, for which I will vote for President.</p>
<p>Tibet might have some problems, but so does New Orleans. Leave politics aside, Olympics are about sports.</p>
