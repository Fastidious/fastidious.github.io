      <p>Back in 2011 was the last time <a href="/2011/05/13/upcoming-presidential-elections/">I wrote</a> about Presidential Elections (2012). I can&rsquo;t believe we are about to get into them again. In 2012 I knew exactly who to vote for, but in 2016, with the <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election,_2016">selection we have</a> thus far, I really have no idea about who is the most viable&mdash;if there is one. Certainly <em>not</em> <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2016">this one</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: &ldquo;How will you bring back the American Dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Trump</strong>: &ldquo;Look, We can bring the American Dream back. That I will tell you. We&rsquo;re bringing it back. OK? And I understand what you&rsquo;re saying. And I get that from so many people. &ldquo;Is The American Dream dead?&rdquo; They are asking me the question, &ldquo;Is the American Dream dead?&rdquo; And the American Dream is in trouble. That I can tell you. OK? It&rsquo;s in trouble. But we&rsquo;re going to get it back and do some real jobs. How about the man with that beautiful red hat? Stand up! Stand up! What a hat!&rdquo;</p>
