<p>A steady, yet gentle, rain was falling over Miami on the night of 24th November 2010. Some say rain are tears from the sky. I was crying as well. On 24th November my father died.</p>
<p>Those who have lost an infinitely dear one will understand how I feel. Not only did I lose the best father a son could have, I lost a lifetime friend, a restless protector, a confidant. The many memories that I have of him continue to bring tears. It hurts so much!</p>
<p>This entry is just another way I have to bring homage to him. My memories of him will one day die with me; until then I will never, ever, forget him.</p>
