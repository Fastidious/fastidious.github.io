      <p>Just a quick post, short and sweet, while my wife and kid still sleep and I patiently wait for the ServerBeach people to fix the mess on my server (the other server). Can you believe that I lost connection last night, went to sleep and this morning I found that my IP goes to a Windows 2003 server? Boy, talk about some big time screw up!</p>
<p>I have 15 (fifteen, that is) invitations for <a href="http://www.gmail.com/" title="Google Email">Gmail</a> that I am giving out for free. If anyone wants one, go ahead and <a href="mailto:david.collantes@gmail.com">email me</a>. No, I am not asking for anything back, just wanting to share the joy of Gmail.</p>
<p>Another thing, Dovecot is awesome! If you use IMAP  you ought to give it a try, honestly. Be sure to use <a href="http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html" title="Using Maildir format">Maildir</a>!</p>
