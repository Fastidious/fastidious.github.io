      <p>Another weekend has gone by, way faster than I expected. Being a husband, a father and a head of the household have it&rsquo;s tradeoffs, although it is not that bad, after all. The things I do not like about it? For starters, white hair. A lot, all over my head. There is also the missing hair, quite more concerning than the first. There is also the fat on the abdominal part, the pain on the joins and neck and the morning&rsquo;s dragon breath. Yes, it has it&rsquo;s tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Everything in life has a price, but waking up in the morning by the sound of my son&rsquo;s sweet voice asking for papá is priceless. Yes, another weekend gone by&hellip; and I just look forward to the next.</p>
