      <p>I used to listen to talk radio after 3PM. I listened at the Sean Hannity show, on WDBO 580AM. I just realized yesterday his &lsquo;show&rsquo; is a radio political &ndash;and biased&ndash; version of &ldquo;The Jerry Springer&rdquo; show. Full of junk, inaccuracies, lies sprinkled with some trues, repetitive. I should have stopped at junk.</p>
<p>And I listened for the entertainment, for the laugh it gives every once in a while, and as a background noise on my way home. But still, garbage. I will not more listen to it. Just grew tired of, well, it&rsquo;s daily junk.</p>
