Subject:  Office rendering
</pre>
<p>One thing we have got to change in our strategy - allowing Office documents to be rendered very well by other peoples browsers is one of the most destructive things we could do to the company.</p>
<p>We have to stop putting any effort into this and make sure that Office documents very well depends on PROPRIETARY IE capabilities.</p>
<p>Anything else is suicide for our platform. This is a case where Office has to avoid doing something to destory (<em>It seems Bill do not use spell checking or, at least, did not use it in 1998</em>) Windows.</p>
<p>I would be glad to explain at greater length.</p>
<p>Likewise this love of DAV in Office/Exchange is a huge problem. I would also like to make sure people understand this as well.</p>

<p>Really, Bill?</p>
