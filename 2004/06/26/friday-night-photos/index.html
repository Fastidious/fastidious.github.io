Oh, and to say good bye to some other family that was visiting from California. As it is normal when family gets together, everything started quite early &ndash;5:30PM&ndash; and finished around 9:30PM. That simply means that food and beer was no longer available at that time ;-) .

      <p>As I previously mentioned, last night some family members got together in our home to eat and drink. Oh, and to say good bye to some other family that was visiting from California. As it is normal when family gets together, everything started quite early &ndash;5:30PM&ndash; and finished around 9:30PM.  That simply means that food and beer was no longer available at that time ;-) .</p>
<p>Normally I am the one taking the photos around, taking care of this kids and later on posting things here. Last night I just needed to take care of the kids, while Kim acted like a photographer around. Easily is to imagine that the quality of the photos is amateurish, but they will do for now, mainly for family viewing. I wish there were more. Next time I will not let Kim take my job, she did not take not even one picture of KM!</p>
