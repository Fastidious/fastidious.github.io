      <p>I must admit, before I continue, that I did not exercise last night.  At least, not as I had intended. It is my fault, I became lazy and even though Kim pushed me well, it did not worked out. But&hellip; I am proud the say that I just walked three miles this morning and, boy, it felt good. I know it is not a sensational &ldquo;news&rdquo;, but I wanted to mark the day of my come back. I will be fit in no time. I have to. I must. Next, I will buy a pedometer.
