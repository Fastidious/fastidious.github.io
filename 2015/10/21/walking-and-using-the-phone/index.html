      <p>Walking around with your head stuck on the phone is like playing the chicken game. The fully aware pedestrian walking in your opposite direction&mdash;and on the same path&mdash;is forced to play the game. Not as dangerous as <a href="/2006/05/16/do-not-phone-and-drive/">driving</a> but still very annoying. When you walk, please pay attention, look where you are walking, and leave the phone in your pocket.</p>
