      <p>Had to chat with an AT&amp;T employee, as a result of an order I placed yesterday. This is the feedback I left (with minor spelling corrections), after concluding the chat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chat experience was excellent (chat agent, Marry). AT&amp;T experience thus far, not quite so.</p>
<p>I had an AT&amp;T sales agent visit me yesterday. I signed up for Internet 1Gbps (Internet 1000 on AT&amp;T lingo), and phone service (transferring my current number). I have a signed form, with all one time service charges waived. The appointment was set for Saturday, 21 October, 2017, from 11 to 13 hours.</p>
<p>Received many emails from AT&amp;T, one of which was asking me to call AT&amp;T &ldquo;for additional information.&rdquo; It seems it was to place the order! (again?). Was told installation weekends were no longer available for the remainder of the year (what?). I accepted begrudgingly, and finalised the order (telephone agent Cristina, #CC872V).</p>
<p>I went on to check my on-line billing, and saw I was being charged $99 for &ldquo;one time charges&rdquo; (the same ones waived to begin with!). Came on-line to chat, and Marry wasn&rsquo;t able to deducted it, but told me to call again after installation, to get credit for it. He cancelled, and recreated the order, trying to deduct the &ldquo;one time charges&rdquo; to no avail.</p>
<p>Bottom line, very disorganised experience. It might not matter much to you, but it doesn&rsquo;t give me the &ldquo;warm, fuzzy feelings.&rdquo; My service hasn&rsquo;t started, but I am already starting to regret it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my feedback.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As of now, my on-line bill still shows a $33 &ldquo;one time charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong class="note_update">Addendum <span class="note_update_timestamp">09 Oct 2017</span></strong></p>
<p>I cancelled the service, even before it was installed. Really bad experience.</p>
