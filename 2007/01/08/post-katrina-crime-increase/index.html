      <p>Ever since after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katrina">Katrina</a> we have seeing crime increase to levels never saw before in Orlando. Crime has been so high, that it has placed our city on the top most 25 dangerous cities in the States. Orlando, City Beautiful, rated higher than Miami on crime. Every single day more than 4-5 people die victim of a violent crime. Others get injured. It seems <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/15/national/main1895797.shtml">other</a> cities/states are <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=1320056">experiencing</a> similar <a href="http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=6929">problems</a>.</p>
<p>I have worked for almost 10 years at <a href="http://www.ucf.edu/">UCF</a> and I never saw graffiti on restrooms walls. All that changed last year&mdash;and even this new 2007. Graffiti, trash left over and things getting destroyed is becoming part of the Campus daily life. So sad.</p>
<p>I want my city back!</p>
