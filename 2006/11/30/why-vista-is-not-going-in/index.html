      <p>I was talking &mdash;well, chatting&mdash; the other day with a <a href="http://george.tsiokos.com/" title="George Tsiokos" alt="George Tsiokos">friend of mine</a> and he was telling me some bad experiences he had had with a Windows Media Center upgrade. That got me talking about Windows Vista, perhaps it is because Windows Vista Ultimate comes with it, I am not sure. Anyways&hellip;</p>
<p>I told my friend I am not installing Vista (although I have Windows Vista Ultimate &mdash;the final version of Vista, no beta, no RC, but final&mdash; as part of my MSDN subscription). And I listed three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Windows Vista doesn&rsquo;t offer anything that I need and, sincerely, nothing that I want (I know, I should have stopped here, and make it a one point reason).</li>
<li>Not all the devices/parts I have on my home built machine will have Windows Vista drivers, hence they might not work right, or might not work at all.</li>
<li>Even if Vista had something that I needed/wanted, I am not willing to sacrifice my current applications/games performance, by sharing the available resources (video memory, system memory, CPU, etc) with an OS that is, indeed, resource hungry.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that.</p>
