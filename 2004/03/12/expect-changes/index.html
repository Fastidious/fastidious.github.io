      <p>I know it has been a long time. I guess other things are using my mind and what&rsquo;s left is not enough to dedicate on this. I have been back in Orlando for two weeks already, time is flying.</p>
<p>Wanted to get DSL, ordered and before receiving the modem cancelled. Bell South wants you to use their SMTP server and nothing else and I can not accept that. Modem is going back and I am back to my old cable modem.</p>
<p>Placed two cameras for auction on eBay, they are not selling that well. Let&rsquo;s keep hoping for the best (The cameras sold at a good price! I never knew I had such valuable things on hand).</p>
<p>Presidential election race is heating up, get ready for what is to come. It is going to be very interesting, as always. I love the pre-election &ldquo;fights&rdquo; and what-nots. I am voting for the cowboy, giving him another four years as a benefit of the doubt. I am glad some <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com/" title="Howard Dean">arses</a> are out of the race. Never liked the guy. Kerry might have some hope. Time will tell.</p>
<p>I am thinking on changing things around here, once again. Or perhaps I will focus a bit on <a href="http://www.babbler.us/" title="It is coming!">Babbler</a>. Gosh, I want a digital camera so badly!</p>
<p>Going to watch a movie but I may go to sleep. Ah, the weekend!</p>
