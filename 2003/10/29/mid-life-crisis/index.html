      <p>When does mid-life crisis starts? I mean, how old do you need to be to start feeling the effects of it and, furthermore, what are such effects?</p>
<p>The reason I am asking all this is because, even thought I am barely on my 35th,  I think &ndash;I just have that impression&ndash; that I am slowly, but at a very fast pace (talk about paradox here!), moving into my own version of mid-life crisis. I want to think it is version 1.0. Now, how many versions and for how long?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on with me? Hmm, hard to explain, specially without getting into trouble. Let&rsquo;s say that I feel the urge to travel to exotic places and meet new people, just like I used to meet them when I was single, so long ago. I, as Homer Simpson, want to &ldquo;<em>shake off the dust of this one-horse town. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want to visit strange, exotic malls&hellip; I want to live&hellip;</em>&rdquo; It is interesting, because I would, truthfully, like to do all of the above.</p>
<p>I feel like getting away from everything that produces an electrical shock at times; I feel like going back to a more primitive, so to speak, kind of life: grow potatoes and tomatoes to live of, milk a cow, hurd some goats&hellip; I don&rsquo;t feel like shaving or worrying about dressing. I want to be a mix of Robinson Crusoe, Robin Hood, Homer Simpson, who knows who else&hellip; and me. Didn&rsquo;t I say it was hard to explain?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve caught myself thinking, what if? Finding every twist of the road I could have taken, totally different or parallel to where I am now. Perhaps on each of them I would be feeling like I am right now, perhaps not. I&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>I sure hope this stage moves on quickly. It is keeping a bitter taste on my mouth, sort of.</p>
