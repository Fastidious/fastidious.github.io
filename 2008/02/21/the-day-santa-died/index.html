      <p>Kim and I have always told Kent Santa exists. Almost every kid is told the same, and get presents delivered by the fat, white bearded guy each year. <a href="/2007/12/19/santa-gets-the-extra-love/" title="Santa get the extra love">He gets all the credits</a>, but kids are happy.</p>
<p>With Kent getting into first grade, he has been hearing things from his peers. Things like, &ldquo;Santa doesn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo;, &ldquo;Santa isn&rsquo;t real&rdquo;, so he began asking about it. About a month ago I told him his peers weren&rsquo;t right, when he commented about it, and that by not believing in Santa they might not get presents next time. Kent dropped the topic.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he asked me, &ldquo;Tell me the truth Papá, is Santa real?&rdquo; I do not lie. But even if I ever will, I will never lie to my kid, no matter what it takes. I had to tell him the truth. Yes, he was disappointed, sad perhaps, a bit, but then he asked, &ldquo;Will I still get presents?&rdquo;. &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;, I replied. Light came to his eyes and face again, and life went on.</p>
<p>Thank you, Santa, for the good memories.</p>
