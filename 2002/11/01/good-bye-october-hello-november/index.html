      <p>Today was a long day. I went to the dentist in the morning, with no little stress. Even though I has been going to the dentist since I was 5 years old, when I grew older I also grew a fear of them, I do not know why. Got to the dentist at 10:30 AM and, between x-rays and &ldquo;impressions&rdquo; (they put like a mold on your mouth to create a replica of your tooth in plastic), explanations and work (a crown), I ended up staying for almost 3 hours. I do have to admit that it is the first time I go to a dentist and I do not feel the anesthetic shots at all. That guy, <a href="http://goo.gl/6MdDd" title="Dr. Sipp office in Google Maps">Dr. Sipp</a>, has a pretty &ldquo;suave&rdquo; hand and a charming personality. That added to the fact that he is an excellent dentist made all the fear disappear.</p>
<p>I got home around 2:00 PM and, even though I had planned to go to work, I felt still numb and with a coming headache, so I decided to stay home. Took tylenol, went to bed and&hellip; voila! &hellip;slept until 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Wrapping up, today Kent Martin got hurt. He got his index finger caught on a closing door. Thanks God it is not broken, but it hurts him&hellip; and us (Kim and I).</p>
<p>Finally, we just came from Blockbuster. We took home &ldquo;SpiderMan&rdquo; and I shall post my humble opinion after I see it. And that is about it!</p>
<p>Good night everyone, and nice and safe weekend!</p>
