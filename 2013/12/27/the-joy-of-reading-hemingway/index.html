      <p>Recently, Kent had the misfortune of picking &ldquo;<a href="https://itun.es/us/EGCVw.l">A Moveable Feast</a>&rdquo;, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, for a school assignment. I know I am not the right person<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to judge <em>anyone&rsquo;s</em> writing style, I am simply recollecting the comments Kent has made while reading the book.</p>
<p>So far, other than finding the book boring &mdash; mind it, he is barely 13 &mdash; he is puzzled at the use of French terms that he wonders how would the &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; American reader comprehend. Usage of French words such as &ldquo;quais&rdquo;, &ldquo;sérieux&rdquo;, &ldquo;génération perdue&rdquo;, &ldquo;foie de veau&rdquo;, &ldquo;valet de chambre&rdquo;, &ldquo;fritures&rdquo;, etc. throw him off, and make reading and overall comprehending difficult. But what has amused him the most is the way Hemingway writes some sentences, very long, and with a pronounced used of the word &ldquo;and.&rdquo; For example (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I knew several of the men who fished the fruitful parts of the Seine between the Île St.-Louis <strong>and</strong> the Place du Verte Galente <strong>and</strong> sometimes, if the day was bright, I would buy a liter of wine <strong>and</strong> a piece of bread <strong>and</strong> some sausage <strong>and</strong> sit in the sun <strong>and</strong> read one of the books I had bought <strong>and</strong> watch the fishing.”</p>
<p>Excerpt from: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, <em>&ldquo;A Moveable Feast&rdquo;</em>, <a href="https://itun.es/us/EGCVw.l">iBooks</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, isn&rsquo;t that amazing? Not only the sentence&rsquo;s length, but the &ldquo;ands!&rdquo; The book has many more sentences like this, a one paragraph sentence. Anyway, I cannot tell you how sorry he is for picking this book.</p>
