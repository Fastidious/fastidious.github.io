      <p>A while ago I wrote about a spam <a href="/2003/09/29/dissecting-a-nigerian-scam/">I got from Nigeria</a> (of course, we all know it could be from anywhere) and how Mr. Tanko lost his Internet connection when <a href="/2003/09/29/dissecting-a-nigerian-scam/">I asked for $20</a>. While it is true that before and after that posting I have gotten quite a few other offers of the kind, none of them came from a man in the United Arab Emirates, supposedly. Now, that is not the unusual thing about this one.</p>
<p>You see, this one is an ill man. Emmanuel Khan is an ill man to which his family has turned their back and stole a considerable amount of his money. Before becoming ill &mdash;from esophageal cancer&mdash; he managed to &ldquo;distribute money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia&rdquo;, but now he can&rsquo;t longer do it. That is why he is asking for my help to distribute it to several other charitable organizations around the world.</p>
<p>Now, the interesting (or funny) part of this whole thing is that, after my reply in which I expressed my willingness to help,  he even sent me his photo, supposedly taken in a hospital, so I could know that it was him. He wanted to make sure I could &ldquo;see&rdquo; his misery. See it for yourself:</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t he inspire compassion? What wouldn&rsquo;t you do for that poor man? Wouldn&rsquo;t you help him? If you want, please email him offering your help (there is a 20% commission out of several millions for you) at Emmanuel Khan&rsquo;s email addresses, <a href="mailto:emmauelkhan@netscape.net">here</a> or <a href="mailto:emmankhan@yahoo.com">here</a>. Tell him I sent you and offer to buy him a better digital camera, please! :-)</p>
