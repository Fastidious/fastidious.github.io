 Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

address</a> at
<a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, in 2005:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve
ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because
almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of
embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of
death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are
going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not
to follow your heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.
Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other
people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out
your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow
your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly
want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">whole
text</a> is
very nice, a good read and (for now) timeless.</p>
