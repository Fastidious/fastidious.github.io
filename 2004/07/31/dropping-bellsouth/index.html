      <p>Our VoIP gateway shipped yesterday and it should reach us around August 3rd (Tuesday). We are going to try Voice over IP technology and service, from <a href="http://www.lingo.com/" title="Lingo">Lingo</a>. The reason why? Save money. Lingo VoIP service is $20 for unlimited long distance for US, Canada and Western Europe. Very &ndash;very&ndash; competitive fees to the rest of the world. And you get all the other goodies (caller ID, call waiting, return call, *69, voicemail, etc. <a href="https://www.lingo.com/guWeb/com/primustel/gu/presentation/residential/home_plans_plus.jsp" title="Do you Lingo?">See more</a> on their website).</p>
<p>I will post my review of the service and equipment later on. We have decided to port our number over VoIP, if the service delivers. We will also get a Miami local number &ndash;also free&ndash;, so my parents can call us anytime at no charge. Goodies!</p>
