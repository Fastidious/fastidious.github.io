Happy 228th Birthday, America!
 On July 4th, 1776, we claimed our independence from Great Britain (now United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) and Democracy was born. Every day thousands leave their homeland to come to the &ldquo;land of the free and the home of the brave&rdquo; so they can begin their American Dream." />

<p><strong>Happy 228th Birthday, America!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On July 4th, 1776, we claimed our independence from Great Britain (now United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) and Democracy was born. Every day thousands leave their homeland to come to the &ldquo;land of the free and the home of the brave&rdquo; so they can begin their American Dream.</p>
<p>The United States is truly a diverse nation made up of dynamic people. Each year on July 4th, Americans celebrate that freedom and independence with barbecues, picnics, and family gatherings. Through the Internet we are learning about and communicating with people of different nations, with different languages and different races throughout the world. Bringing the world closer with understanding and knowledge can only benefit all nations.</p>
<p>We invite all nations to celebrate with Americans online this Fourth of July. Happy Birthday, America! &ndash;<cite><a href="http://www.usacitylink.com/usa/" title="Happy Birthday America">USA CityLink</a></cite></p>
