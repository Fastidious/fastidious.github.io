      <p>This is not merely a technical problem, but I did not have the choice for multiple selections. Anytime I use the word &ldquo;you&rdquo; down below, I mean Amazon.</p>
<p>First the good. I love you, I have used AWS S3 for a long time, no complains. I do much of my online purchases on you, although I am not a fervent shopper. I rent my movies on Amazon Video. I am signed up for Flex. I want you to succeed even more. I love you!</p>
<p>Now the bad. Amazon Cloud Drive is bad. The OS X client is clunky, far from streamlined, and dull. It can&rsquo;t compete with Google Drive client&ndash;and that is bad, because the Google Drive client is far from being good. The web interface is extremely slow, it times out, it is featureless. It can&rsquo;t render SVGs (maybe not even RAW images, I have not uploaded my photos and videos yet), it can&rsquo;t play MP3s, or any other audio files. I just cancelled my 1 TB with Google Drive to come to Amazon Cloud Drive, but I do not see me keeping it either. Is that bad.</p>
<p>You could have something good going on here, to compete with Google, with Dropbox, with Microsoft. But you either decided not to allocate a big enough team to work on Cloud Drive, or the team you have working on it is learning as it goes. Either way, the end result is a half baked, or raw, product. This makes me sad, you know, like being dumped by girlfriend I really care about.</p>
<p>I am willing to be contacted for recommendations or further feedback.</p>
