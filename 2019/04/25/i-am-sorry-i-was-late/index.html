      <p>I can explain why I was so late, I swear.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning after a brilliant two hours of sleep and went to milk the cow. She did not really have much, so the cereal kinda blew. Anyways, as I turned on my red 1993 Chevy Malibu I realised the garage was not opening. Great, the power was down! I went upstairs with a broom and woke up the hamster,  which must have fallen asleep on the job. It took some deliberation, taking a full three minutes to get the power working again.</p>
<p>I sped out of my local neighbourhood,  keenly aware I was cutting it close on time. Listening to <strong>Aqua’s</strong> &ldquo;<em>Barbie Girl</em>&rdquo; I was ready to take on any traffic peril thrown at my direction. That&rsquo;s when the unexpected occurred. The mother of all meteors bursted at my 9 o’clock. I remained vigilant and undistracted, but the same could not be said about my fellow motorists. The vehicle directly in front of me slammed on his brakes. I was forced to expertly manoeuvre around him using the road’s shoulder. Unfortunately for me, a deceased porcupine happened to be on the shoulder, and caused severe damage to my forward right tire. My vessel was unsafe for travel.</p>
<p>I proceeded the arduous and unsavoury activity of changing the deflating tire. Equipped with a tire iron, I got to work. I fixed my car fairly quickly and I was about to be on my way when a marshal parked behind me. He prompted me if I had slain the aforementioned porcupine. In my sleepy haze I said, &ldquo;<em>Yes</em>&rdquo;. The marshal congratulated me. Apparently the porcupine had been terrorising the region for the last few months. I signed an autograph and went off.</p>
<p>Sadly, despite my best efforts, I was ten minutes late. Please forgive me, Mrs. Lamorte.</p>

<p>The above was writen by Kent, jokingly after I had to sign a tardy for him because he was ten minutes late to class, due to traffic.</p>
