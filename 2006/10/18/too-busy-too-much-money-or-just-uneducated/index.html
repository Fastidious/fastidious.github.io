      <p>Our College is trying to re-design. Our web manager has been assigned to some other project of more importance (Dean&rsquo;s order), so he can&rsquo;t tackle the conversion of the existing website to a full blown CMS driven one. Other than the locals we have seeing and sit through presentations and proposals, I sent emails &ndash;very brief ones, but to the point&ndash; to <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/" title="Dan Cederholm" alt="Dan Cederholm">Dan Cederholm</a>, <a href="http://www.hivelogic.com/" title="Dan Bejamin" alt="Dan Bejamin">Dan Bejamin</a> (we live in the same town), and <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/" title="David Shea" alt="David Shea">David Shea</a>. They are web designers/backend programmers. They do that for a living. None of them has replied, now almost three weeks after the email was sent.</p>
<p>I noticed Dan Benjamin <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/2006/10/16/october_sale" title="Not condoning it, just used as an example" alt="Not condoning it, just used as an example">is selling some used Mac equipment</a>, and he wants to be contacted. &ldquo;Please send me an email and we&rsquo;ll talk.&rdquo;, he writes. I only hope that potential buyers emails go to the same place mine went and receive the same treatment &ndash; It seems he answered the potential buyers really quick, the &ldquo;gear&rdquo; is sold.</p>
<p>I always answer all my valid (not junk/spam) emails. If only to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;Hi&rdquo;. It is called education.</p>
