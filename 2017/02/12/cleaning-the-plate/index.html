      <p>My wife has always told me, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t eat everything in your plate, leave something!&rdquo; It is her believe, and her culture&rsquo;s, that only poor people eats everything, and that if I do so, it will show I am dying of hunger, and thus, poor. If it were so, what&rsquo;s wrong with being poor? Why will I leave food on the plate, food that I really like, to pretend what I am not? I am poor, <em>poor</em>, <strong>poor</strong>!</p>
<p>That custom, though, would be an easy one to follow if the food was bad. That&rsquo;s something impossible when wife cooks, or mum. No kidding.</p>
