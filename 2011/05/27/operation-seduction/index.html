<p>&ldquo;The ritual &mdash;considered old-fashioned nowadays by just about
everyone under the age of 60&mdash; was traditionally a ceremonial, sacred
gesture; its history can be traced to ancient Greece and Rome. In the
Middle Ages, a vassal paid homage to his lord by kissing his hand. By
the 19th century, hand kissing had been reinvented to convey a man&rsquo;s
gallantry and politesse toward a woman. Those men who still practice it
today know the rules: never kiss a gloved hand or the hand of a young
girl; kiss the hand only of a married woman, and do so only indoors.&rdquo;</p>
