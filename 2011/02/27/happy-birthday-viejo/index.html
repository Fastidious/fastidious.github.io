<p>Not a day goes by without me thinking of my Dad. Today he would have
being 92 years old.</p>
<p>I still remember him on his 90th birthday, doing push ups using only
three fingers on each hand. I will forever remember the endless stories
he used to tell, and his constant smile. He was the best father a son
can ask for, an example for many. It hurts so very much not to have him
around anymore&hellip;!</p>
<p>You are not here anymore, but in our minds you are immortal. Happy
Birthday, mi Viejo!</p>
