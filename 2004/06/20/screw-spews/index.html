      <p>Recently I found out that my existing server IP&mdash;the server I am moving away from&mdash;is banned on SPEWS (I am not linking them, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=spews" title="Google query for SPEWS">Google it</a> and you shall know), because it is assigned to UUnet, which is blamed of harbouring spammers. Following the recommendation of the bounced email I <a href="http://goo.gl/Atxoy" title="My post on news.admin.net-abuse.email">posted on Usenet</a>, asking to be removed, without knowing at that time that it was something out of my hands.</p>
<p>While I understand and hate as much as the next that spam has gotten out of proportions, I do not think blocking a whole company will do any good neither. It is the little people &ndash; like me &ndash; the one who get ultimately screwed. Believe me, I hate spam and I used to receive a lot (not any more since I am using <a href="http://www.tmda.net/" title="Tagged Message Delivery Agent">TMDA</a>) but blocking everyone&rsquo;s emails because the business practices of the company that borrows the IP you are using is plain stupid, in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>SPEWS caused an effect on me, totally the opposite of what they expected, I am sure. I was upset and I dislike their initiative, just like I did/do with MAPS or any other wide area blocking system that targets huge name spaces. It is like blocking AOL because a lot of spam comes from a forged AOL account. As I said, stupid. But once again, that is just my humble opinion. The new server IP is not blocked by SPEWS.</p>
<p>On the up side&hellip; <strong>Happy Anniversary, Kim and David!</strong> &ndash; yes, that&rsquo;s us! Today is our 6th marriage anniversary and I can not believe it is being already six years. Time flies. If I could go back and do it all over again, I would. I love my wife dearly.</p>
