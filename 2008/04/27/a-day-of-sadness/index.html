      <p>Today we realized that we have lost our camcorder, and with it, all the memories we had since KM was born: from birth until his last birthday, at least. And the pain we feel can&rsquo;t be explained. How could we be so stupid?!</p>
<p>Although we have thoughts, accusing ourselves for lots of things&hellip; what sense does it make at this point? Everything is gone, and discussing the why&rsquo;s, what if&rsquo;s and so on will not bring the tapes back. Things will be done differently on regards of the archiving of family memories from now on. Very differently. But&hellip;</p>
<p>The only thing we can do is start over. KM has already told me, &ldquo;You can film me all you want, papá&rdquo;, when I explained to him what has happened. And that we shall.</p>
