      <p>I have 6 Gmail invitations that I will give out to anyone who writes a sincere comment about the use it will give to such account, if given. I have been using Gmail for a while now and I can assure you it is a great service, addictive indeed. It is not all about the 1GB of space that Google gives with it, but the excellent features and blazing speed. You can read more about Gmail on the <a href="https://gmail.google.com/support/" title="Gmail Support Center">Gmail Support Center</a>.  I also <a href="/2004/04/17/gmail-hype/" title="Gmail Hype">wrote</a> <a href="/2004/04/22/gmail-is-not-for-everyone/" title="Gmail is not for everyone">about it</a> a while ago.</p>
<p>Be sure to leave a good email address for me to contact you and use your full name (first and lastname). If after a week nobody is interested I will start a search to find people asking for Gmail accounts and give them out.</p>
