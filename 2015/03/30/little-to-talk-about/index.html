<p>I am finding little to talk about lately, and that is keeping things here rather quiet. It is not only that I do not have much to write, but that when the desire arrives it gets lost in translation, mostly because of the way I have decided to handle this little space of mine. The short burts of thoughts are almost tweet alike, but over 140 characters. Twitter then, sometimes, doesn&rsquo;t cut it.</p>
<p>Instead of simply abruptly stopping, I will say that I am pausing. Pausing until something comes along.</p>
