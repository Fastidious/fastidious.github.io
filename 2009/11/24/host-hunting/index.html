      <p>I had had all my websites &mdash;this one, and many other test ones, etc&mdash;, plus my self-managed DNS on <a href="http://serverbeach.com/">ServerBeach</a> (now part of <a href="http://www.peer1.com/">Peer1</a>) for a very long time. They all reside on a dedicated server, which has, sadly, reached it&rsquo;s end of life (EOL).</p>
<p>Although I can keep it as it is, doing so represents a liability problem, as I will be out of luck, should it decide to fail. The problem is, ServerBeach isn&rsquo;t offering anything right now similar to the server I have, for the amount of money I pay. Hence the dilemma. I need to find a host. One that allows/has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple domains hosting</li>
<li>Multiple MySQL databases</li>
<li>Complete control of my own DNS</li>
<li>Ability to compile my own applications and run my own servers (persistent processes)</li>
<li>Good uptime, enough bandwidth not to have to pay for extra</li>
<li>One that doesn&rsquo;t oversells</li>
<li>Decently priced</li>
</ul>
<p>Any recommendations, please?</p>
