Well, it is cold here in Florida. Pretty cold for a State named &ldquo;Sunshine State&rdquo;. The sun shines, no doubt about it. It is shining right now, as I type this, but the temperature is 44 degrees (F). It was even colder overnight, I bet.
Christmas is rapidly approaching and we have no plans. For the first time since I have been working for UCF we are having 4 and a half days off on Christmas and 4 and a half days off on New Year. That&rsquo;s mighty nice. Since we just came from Miami on Thanksgiving, I do not know if family would want to bear with us again so soon (grin). As I said, no plans, but something might come up from now till them." />

      <p>It is snowing out there, somewhere. I hear New York got some snow recently. Other places have been under it&rsquo;s white blanket for a while now. Well, it is cold here in Florida. Pretty cold for a State named &ldquo;Sunshine State&rdquo;. The sun shines, no doubt about it. It is shining right now, as I type this, but the temperature is 44 degrees (F). It was even colder overnight, I bet.</p>
<p>Christmas is rapidly approaching and we have no plans. For the first time since I have been working for <a href="http://www.bus.ucf.edu/" title="College of Business, UCF">UCF</a> we are having 4 and a half days off on Christmas and 4 and a half days off on New Year. That&rsquo;s mighty nice. Since we just came from Miami on Thanksgiving, I do not know if family would want to bear with us again so soon (grin). As I said, no plans, but something might come up from now till them.</p>
<p>I have been busy at work and I will probably be till Christmas. There are a few things that need to be done, but there is always something coming in between to slow me down or I do not feel with the energy to tackle them. I have been stressed out a bit at home, worried about Kent little problems and Kim not having a job. This Christmas will remind me the Christmas of &lsquo;95, on which I did not have a job neither. With the only difference that I did not have a house, a wife or a kid at that time.</p>
<p>Oh well, we will adapt. Tata for now!</p>
