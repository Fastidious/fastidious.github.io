      <p>I am not sure about the other mobile telephony providers, but this morning I went to <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a> with the intention of buying an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>. They had only the dark colour in stock, and on 32GB capacity&mdash;I was wanting a 16GB. The transaction was almost finished, when I was asked for a telephone number. After stating that I just wanted the iPad, no connection, I was told they could only sell it, if it was with a mobile data plan. Business was lost.</p>
<p>Why? If I am buying an iPad, with a cellular radio set for T-Mobile frequencies, why to enforce activation right on the spot? It is absurd. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/millenia/">Apple Store</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, on the other hand, had plenty in all colours, all capacities and no other attachments.</p>

<p>I need to add, the Apple Store at Millenia Mall was packed to the point I could barely walk. Apple is selling a lot this holiday season! <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
